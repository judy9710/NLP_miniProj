Although affected cows are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftiofur, endometrial and ovarian function are not fully recovered, which results in subfertility and infertility. According to culture-dependent studies, uterine pathogens include Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Prevotella melaninogenica. Recent studies using high-throughput sequencing observed very low relative abundance of Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, and Prevotella melaninogenica in cows with metritis.

Genes play a role in almost half of all cases of hearing loss but effective treatment options are very limited. Genetic hearing loss is considered to be extremely genetically heterogeneous. The advancements in genomics have been instrumental to the identification of more than 6,000 causative variants in more than 150 genes causing hearing loss. Identification of genes for hearing impairment provides an increased insight into the normal development and function of cells in the auditory system. These defective genes will ultimately be important therapeutic targets. However, the auditory system is extremely complex which requires tremendous advances in gene therapy including gene vectors, routes of administration, and therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes and discusses recent advances in elucidating the genomics of genetic hearing loss and technologies aimed at developing a gene therapy that may become a treatment option for in the near future.\n",

With over 164 million reported cases per annum, shigellosis accounts for 1.1 million deaths each year. Majority of these cases occur among the children of the developing nations and the emergence of multi-drug resistance Shigella strains in clinical isolates demands the development of better/new drugs against this pathogen. The genome of Shigella flexneri was extensively analyzed and found 4,362 proteins among which the functions of 674 proteins, termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs) had not been previously elucidated. Amino acid sequences of all these 674 HPs were studied and the functions of a total of 39 HPs have been assigned with high level of confidence. Here we have utilized a combination of the latest versions of databases to assign the precise function of HPs for which no experimental information is available. These HPs were found to belong to various classes of proteins such as enzymes, binding proteins, signal transducers, lipoprotein, transporters, virulence and other proteins. Evaluation of the performance of the various computational tools conducted using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and a resoundingly high average accuracy of 93.6% were obtained. Our comprehensive analysis will help to gain greater understanding for the development of many novel potential therapeutic interventions to defeat Shigella infection.\n",

However, it is still unknown how much of the genetic alterations identified in primary tumors are consistently detected in tumor tissues in the PDX model. In this study, we analyzed the genetic alterations of three primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) and matched xenograft tissues in PDX models using a next-generation sequencing cancer panel. Of the 17 somatic mutations identified from the three CRCs, 14 (82.4%) were consistently identified in both primary and xenograft tumors. The other three mutations identified in the primary tumor were not detected in the xenograft tumor tissue. There was no newly identified mutation in the xenograft tumor tissues. In addition to the somatic mutations, the copy number alteration profiles were also largely consistent between the primary tumor and xenograft tissue. All of these data suggest that the PDX tumor model preserves the majority of the key mutations detected in the primary tumor site. This study provides evidence that the PDX model is useful for testing targeted therapies in the clinical field and research on precision medicine.\n",

The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level.

In this study, we compared the performance of two major sequencers (MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000) to test whether the MGISEQ-2000 sequencer delivers high-quality sequence data as suggested. We performed RNA sequencing of four human colon cancer samples with the two platforms, and compared the sequencing quality and expression values. The data produced from the MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000 showed high concordance, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. Various quality control (QC) analyses showed that the MGISEQ-2000 data fulfilled the required QC measures.

            "Survival analysis mainly deals with the time to event, including death, onset of disease, and bankruptcy. The common characteristic of survival analysis is that it contains “censored” data, in which the time to event cannot be completely observed, but instead represents the lower bound of the time to event. Only the occurrence of either time to event or censoring time is observed. Many traditional statistical methods have been effectively used for analyzing survival data with censored observations. However, with the development of high-throughput technologies for producing “omics” data, more advanced statistical methods, such as regularization, should be required to construct the predictive survival model with high-dimensional genomic data. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have been adapted for survival analysis, to fit nonlinear and complex interaction effects between predictors, and achieve more accurate prediction of individual survival probability. Presently, since most clinicians and medical researchers can easily assess statistical programs for analyzing survival data, a review article is helpful for understanding statistical methods used in survival analysis. We review traditional survival methods and regularization methods, with various penalty functions, for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics, and describe machine learning techniques that have been adapted to survival analysis.\n",

The objective of this study was to analyze the antibacterial characteristics of the different fluoroquinolones. Also, the pharmacological properties of the compounds including the Lipinski rule of five, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, LD50, drug likeliness, and toxicity were evaluated. We found that among all four FQ molecules, ofloxacin showed the highest antibacterial activity through in silico assays with a strong interaction (−38.52 kJ/mol) with the antibacterial target protein (topoisomerase-II DNA gyrase enzyme). The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic analysis also showed that the compounds ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and norfloxacin have good pharmacological properties. Notably, ofloxacin was found to possess an IGC50 (concentration needed to inhibit 50% growth) value of 0.286 μg/L against the Tetrahymena pyriformis protozoa.

            "Incorporation of unique barcodes into fission yeast gene deletion collections has enabled the identification of gene functions by growth fitness analysis. For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.\n",

            "In this report, we present a case study of how pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics can be useful to characterize safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in early phase new drug development clinical trials. During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.\n",

Landrace and Yorkshire pigs are important pork-providing breeds. Although quantitative trait loci of pigs are well-developed, significant genes in GWASs of pigs in Korea must be studied. Through a GWAS using the PLINK program, study of the significant genes in Korean pigs was performed. We conducted a GWAS and surveyed the gene ontology (GO) terms associated with the backfat thickness (BF) trait of these pigs. We included the breed information (Yorkshire and Landrace pigs) as a covariate. The significant genes after false discovery rate (<0.01) correction were AFG1L, SCAI, RIMS1, and SPDEF. The major GO terms for the top 5% of genes were related to neuronal genes, cell morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization. The neuronal genes were previously reported as being associated with backfat thickness.

These findings clearly indicate potential clinical implications of miRNAs, such as autoantigen expression and autoantibody production, viral miRNAs regulating the calcium signaling pathway, and aberrant immune cell regulation and cytokine production. Research endeavors in the field are currently underway to select disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by utilizing different types of tissues or biological specimens of SjS patients. Various techniques for miRNA analysis with different stringencies have been applied, with the most recent one being next-generation sequencing. This review compiles and highlights differentially-expressed miRNAs in various samples collected from SjS patients and their potential implications in the pathogenesis of SjS. To facilitate the development of miRNA-targeted personalized therapy in the future, we urge more follow-up studies that confirm these findings and elucidate the immunopathological roles of differentially-expressed miRNAs. Furthermore, improved diagnostic criteria for the disease itself will minimize sampling errors in patient recruitment, preventing the generation of inconsistent data.\n",

            "Virus taxonomy was initially determined by clinical experiments based on phenotype. However, with the development of sequence analysis methods, genotype-based classification was also applied. With the development of genome sequence analysis technology, there is an increasing demand for virus taxonomy to be extended from in vivo and in vitro to in silico. In this study, we verified the consistency of the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses taxonomy using an in silico approach, aiming to identify the specific sequence for each virus. We applied this approach to norovirus in Caliciviridae, which causes 90% of gastroenteritis cases worldwide. First, based on the dogma “protein structure determines its function,” we hypothesized that the specific sequence can be identified by the specific structure. Firstly, we extracted the coding region (CDS). Secondly, the CDS protein sequences of each genus were annotated by the conserved domain database (CDD) search. Finally, the conserved domains of each genus in Caliciviridae are classified by RPS-BLAST with CDD. The analysis result is that Caliciviridae has sequences including RNA helicase in common. In case of Norovirus, Calicivirus coat protein C terminal and viral polyprotein N-terminal appears as a specific domain in Caliciviridae. It does not include in the other genera in Caliciviridae. If this method is utilized to detect specific conserved domains, it can be used as classification keywords based on protein functional structure. After determining the specific protein domains, the specific protein domain sequences would be converted to gene sequences. This sequences would be re-used one of viral bio-marks.\n",

            "Hybrid capture-based targeted sequencing is being used increasingly for genomic variant profiling in tumor patients. Unique molecular index (UMI) technology has recently been developed and helps to increase the accuracy of variant calling by minimizing polymerase chain reaction biases and sequencing errors. However, UMI-adopted targeted sequencing data analysis is slightly different from the methods for other types of omics data, and its pipeline for variant calling is still being optimized in various study groups for their own purposes. Due to this provincial usage of tools, our group built an analysis pipeline for global application to many studies of targeted sequencing generated with different methods. First, we generated hybrid capture-based data using genomic DNA extracted from tumor tissues of colorectal cancer patients. Sequencing libraries were prepared and pooled together, and an 8-plexed capture library was processed to the enrichment step before 150-bp paired-end sequencing with Illumina HiSeq series. For the analysis, we evaluated several published tools. We focused mainly on the compatibility of the input and output of each tool. Finally, our laboratory built an analysis pipeline specialized for UMI-adopted data. Through this pipeline, we were able to estimate even on-target rates and filtered consensus reads for more accurate variant calling. These results suggest the potential of our analysis pipeline in the precise examination of the quality and efficiency of conducted experiments.\n",

A total of 22.2 and 21.8 raw reads were obtained from chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively. These reads were assembled using the Oases assembly platform and resulted in 26,036 and 21,854 contigs with N50 values of 929 and 933 base pairs, respectively. Functional gene annotations through pathway analyses of the Gene Ontology, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were performed for each blood transcriptome, resulting in a similar compositional order between the two transcriptomes. Ortholog comparisons with previously published transcriptomes from the Adélie (P. adeliae) and emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins revealed that a high proportion of the four penguins’ transcriptomes had significant sequence homology. Because blood and tissues of penguins have been used to monitor pollution in Antarctica, immune parameters in blood could be important indicators for understanding the health status of penguins and other Antarctic animals. In the blood transcriptomes, KEGG analyses detected many essential genes involved in the major innate immunity pathways, which are key metabolic pathways for maintaining homeostasis against exogenous infections or toxins. Blood transcriptome studies such as this may be useful for checking the immune and health status of penguins without sacrifice.\n",

            "\n",
            "Alveolar type II cells constitute a small fraction of the total lung cell mass. However, they play an important role in many cellular processes including trans-differentiation into type I cells as well as repair of lung injury in response to toxic chemicals and respiratory pathogens. Transcription factors are the regulatory proteins dynamically modulating DNA structure and gene expression. Transcription factor profiling in microarray datasets revealed that several members of AP1, ATF, NF-kB, and C/EBP families involved in diverse responses were expressed in mouse lung type II cells. A transcriptional factor signature consisting of Cebpa, Srebf1, Stat3, Klf5, and Elf3 was identified in lung type II cells, Sox9+ pluripotent lung stem cells as well as in mouse lung development. Identification of the transcription factor profile in mouse lung type II cells will serve as a useful resource and facilitate the integrated analysis of signal transduction pathways and specific gene targets in a variety of physiological conditions.\n",

            "\n",
            "Cysticercosis, a parasitic disease caused by Taenia solium metacestode (TsM), has a major global public health impact in terms of disability-adjusted life years. The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms. This article briefly overviews diagnostic approaches and discusses current issues relating to NC serodiagnosis.\n",

            "\n",
            "Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are classified as RNAs that are longer than 200 nucleotides and cannot be translated into protein. Several studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs are directly or indirectly involved in a variety of biological processes and in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, lncRNAs have important roles in many diseases including cancer. It has been shown that abnormal expression of lncRNAs is observed in several human solid tumors. Several studies have shown that many lncRNAs can function as oncogenes in cancer development through the induction of cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and invasion, anti-apoptosis, and metastasis. Oncogenic lncRNAs have the potential to become promising biomarkers and might be potent prognostic targets in cancer therapy. However, the biological and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA involvement in tumorigenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. This review summarizes studies on the regulatory and functional roles of oncogenic lncRNAs in the development and progression of various types of cancer.\n",

            "Athletic performance is a complex multifactorial trait involving genetic and environmental factors. The heritability of an athlete status was reported to be about 70% in a twin study, and at least 155 genetic markers are known to be related with athlete status. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential proteins for oxidative phosphorylation, which is related to aerobic capacity. Thus, mtDNA is a candidate marker for determining physical performance. Recent studies have suggested that polymorphisms of mtDNA are associated with athlete status and/or physical performance in various populations. Therefore, we analyzed mtDNA haplogroups to assess their association with the physical performance of Korean population. The 20 mtDNA haplogroups were determined using the SNaPshot assay. Our result showed a significant association of the haplogroup F with athlete status (odds ratio, 3.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.094 to 8.464; p = 0.012). Athletes with haplogroup F (60.64 ± 3.04) also demonstrated a higher Sargent jump than athletes with other haplogroups (54.28 ± 1.23) (p = 0.041). Thus, our data imply that haplogroup F may play a crucial role in the physical performance of Korean athletes. Functional studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to further substantiate these findings.\n",

            "\n",
            "To identify miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs associated with binary phenotypes, we propose a hierarchical structural component model for miRNA-mRNA integration (HisCoM-mimi). Information on known mRNA targets provided by TargetScan is used to perform HisCoM-mimi. However, multiple databases can be used to find miRNA-mRNA signatures with known biological information through different algorithms. To take these additional databases into account, we present our advanced application software for HisCoM-mimi for binary phenotypes. The proposed HisCoM-mimi supports both TargetScan and miRTarBase, which provides manually-verified information initially gathered by text-mining the literature. By integrating information from miRTarBase into HisCoM-mimi, a broad range of target information derived from the research literature can be analyzed. Another improvement of the new HisCoM-mimi approach is the inclusion of updated algorithms to provide the lasso and elastic-net penalties for users who want to fit a model with a smaller number of selected miRNAs and mRNAs. We expect that our HisCoM-mimi software will make advanced methods accessible to researchers who want to identify miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs related with binary phenotypes.\n",

            "Identification of fusion gene is of prominent importance in cancer research field because of their potential as carcinogenic drivers. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data have been the most useful source for identification of fusion transcripts. Although a number of algorithms have been developed thus far, most programs produce too many false-positives, thus making experimental confirmation almost impossible. We still lack a reliable program that achieves high precision with reasonable recall rate. Here, we present FusionScan, a highly optimized tool for predicting fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data. We specifically search for split reads composed of intact exons at the fusion boundaries. Using 269 known fusion cases as the reference, we have implemented various mapping and filtering strategies to remove false-positives without discarding genuine fusions. In the performance test using three cell line datasets with validated fusion cases (NCI-H660, K562, and MCF-7), FusionScan outperformed other existing programs by a considerable margin, achieving the precision and recall rates of 60% and 79%, respectively. Simulation test also demonstrated that FusionScan recovered most of true positives without producing an overwhelming number of false-positives regardless of sequencing depth and read length. The computation time was comparable to other leading tools. We also provide several curative means to help users investigate the details of fusion candidates easily. We believe that FusionScan would be a reliable, efficient and convenient program for detecting fusion transcripts that meet the requirements in the clinical and experimental community.

However, the discovery of druggable neoantigens remains challenging, suggesting that a deeper understanding of the mechanism of neoantigen generation and better strategies to identify them will be required to realize the promise of neoantigen-based immunotherapy. Alternative splicing and RNA editing events are emerging mechanisms leading to neoantigen production. In this review, we outline recent work involving the large-scale screening of neoantigens produced by alternative splicing and RNA editing.

            "Analyzing patterns in data points embedded in linear and non-linear feature spaces is considered as one of the common research problems among different research areas, for example: data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, and multivariate analysis. In this paper, data points are heterogeneous sets of biosequences (composite data points). A composite data point is a set of ordinary data points (e.g., set of feature vectors). We theoretically extend the derivation of the largest generalized eigenvalue-based distance metric Dij (γ1) in any linear and non-linear feature spaces. We prove that Dij (γ1) is a metric under any linear and non-linear feature transformation function. We show the sufficiency and efficiency of using the decision rule δΞi (i.e., mean of Dij (γ1)) in classification of heterogeneous sets of biosequences compared with the decision rules minΞi and medianΞi. We analyze the impact of linear and non-linear transformation functions on classifying/clustering collections of heterogeneous sets of biosequences. The impact of the length of a sequence in a heterogeneous sequence-set generated by simulation on the classification and clustering results in linear and non-linear feature spaces is empirically shown in this paper. We propose a new concept: the limiting dispersion map of the existing clusters in heterogeneous sets of biosequences embedded in linear and nonlinear feature spaces, which is based on the limiting distribution of nucleotide compositions estimated from real data sets. Finally, the empirical conclusions and the scientific evidences are deduced from the experiments to support the theoretical side stated in this paper.\n",

During the past decade, genome-wide DNA methylation studies of T2D have expanded our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying T2D. This review summarizes case-control studies of the DNA methylome of T2D and discusses DNA methylation as both a cause and consequence of T2D.

Here, we established a new transcriptome analysis pipeline using a deconvolution process to reduce the heterogeneity and clearly identified that these transcriptome data originated from the mild or moderate stage of COPD patients. Differentially expressed or co-expressed genes in the protein interaction subnetworks were linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune response, as expected. Computational protein localization prediction revealed that 19 proteins showing changes in subcellular localization were mostly related to mitochondria, suggesting that mislocalization of mitochondria-targeting proteins plays an important role in COPD pathology. Our extensive evaluation of COPD transcriptome data could provide guidelines for analyzing heterogeneous gene expression profiles and classifying potential candidate genes that are responsible for the pathogenesis of COPD.\n",

Functional enrichment analysis revealed that various differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular processes including the cell cycle, chromosome breakage and repair, and microtubule formation; all of which may be related to the occurrence and maintenance of B chromosomes.

            "In 1966, the International Classification of Viruses (ICNV) was established to standardize the naming of viruses. In 1975, the organization was renamed “International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),” by which it is still known today. The primary virus classification provided by ICTV in 1971 was for viruses infecting vertebrates, which includes 19 genera, 2 families, and 24 unclassified groups. Presently, the 10th virus taxonomy has been published. However, the early classification of viruses was based on clinical results “in vivo” and “in vitro,” as well as on the shape of the Phenotype virus. Due to the development of next-generation sequencing and the accompanying bioinformatics analysis pipelines, a reconstruction of the classification system has been proposed. At a meeting held in Boston, USA between June 9-11, 2016, there was even an in-depth discussion regarding the classification of viruses using metagenomic data. One suggested activity that arose from the meeting was that viral taxonomy should be reconstructed, based on genotype and bioinformatics analysis “in silico.” This article describes our efforts to achieve this goal by construction of a web-based system and the extension of an associated database, based on ICTV taxonomy. This virus taxonomy web system was designed specifically to extend the virus taxonomy up to strain and isolation, which was then connected with the NCBI database to facilitate searches for specific viral genes; there are also links to journals provided by the EMBL RESTful API that improves accessibility for academic groups.\n",

During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.\n",

Taking the International Neuroblastoma Staging System stages as multiple classes, we designed a deep neural network using the gene expression patterns and stages of neuroblastoma patients. Despite a small patient population (n = 280), stage 1 and 4 patients were well distinguished. If it is possible to replicate this approach in a larger population, deep learning could play an important role in neuroblastoma staging.\n",

            "\n",
            "The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is the de facto standard ontology to describe human phenotypes in detail, and it is actively used, particularly in the field of rare disease diagnoses. For clinicians who are not fluent in English, the HPO has been translated into many languages, and there have been four initiatives to develop Japanese translations. At the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6), a rule-based approach was attempted to determine the preferable Japanese translation for each HPO term among the candidates developed by the four approaches. The relationship between the HPO and Mammalian Phenotype translations was also investigated, with the eventual goal of harmonizing the two translations to facilitate phenotype-based comparisons of species in Japanese through cross-species phenotype matching. In order to deal with the increase in the number of HPO terms and the need for manual curation, it would be useful to have a dictionary containing word-by-word correspondences and fixed translation phrases for English word order. These considerations seem applicable to HPO localization into other languages.\n",

            "Incorporation of unique barcodes into fission yeast gene deletion collections has enabled the identification of gene functions by growth fitness analysis. For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.\n",

            "Intratumor heterogeneity within a single tumor mass is one of the hallmarks of malignancy and has been reported in various tumor types. The molecular characterization of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a public resource, an ERBB pathway activated triple-negative cell population was identified. The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.\n",

We are currently developing a Web application to support finding alternative methods to animal experiments. The current (under development) version of the application utilizes external tools and resources for document processing, and relies on the PubAnnotation ecosystem for annotation querying, annotation storage, dictionary-based tagging of cell lines, and annotation visualization. Currently, our two PubAnnotation repositories for discourse elements contain annotations for more than 110k PubMed documents.

            "Named entity recognition tools are used to identify mentions of biomedical entities in free text and are essential components of high-quality information retrieval and extraction systems. Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity “type 1 diabetes” in the phrase “type 1 and type 2 diabetes.” This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE’s existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems.\n",

            "Cysticercosis, a parasitic disease caused by Taenia solium metacestode (TsM), has a major global public health impact in terms of disability-adjusted life years. The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms. This article briefly overviews diagnostic approaches and discusses current issues relating to NC serodiagnosis.\n",

The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative combines over 100 controlled vocabularies into its own. However, the OHDSI vocabulary is limited in the sense that it combines multiple terminologies and does not provide a direct way to link them outside of their own self-contained scope. This issue makes the tasks of enriching feature sets by using external resources extremely difficult. In order to address these shortcomings, we have created a linked data version of the OHDSI vocabulary, connecting it with already established linked resources like bioportal, bio2rdf, etc. with the ultimate purpose of enabling the interoperability of resources previously foreign to the OHDSI universe.\n",

            "Accessible negative results are relevant for researchers and clinicians not only to limit their search space but also to prevent the costly re-exploration of research hypotheses. However, most biomedical relation extraction datasets do not seek to distinguish between a false and a negative relation among two biomedical entities. Furthermore, datasets created using distant supervision techniques also have some false negative relations that constitute undocumented/unknown relations (missing from a knowledge base). We propose to improve the distinction between these concepts, by revising a subset of the relations marked as false on the phenotype-gene relations corpus and give the first steps to automatically distinguish between the false (F), negative (N), and unknown (U) results. Our work resulted in a sample of 127 manually annotated FNU relations and a weighted-F1 of 0.5609 for their automatic distinction.

            "\n",
            "Gene-gene interaction is a key factor for explaining missing heritability. Many methods have been proposed to identify gene-gene interactions. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a well-known method for the detection of gene-gene interactions by reduction from genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism combinations to a binary variable with a value of high risk or low risk. This method has been widely expanded to own a specific objective. Among those expansions, fuzzy-MDR uses the fuzzy set theory for the membership of high risk or low risk and increases the detection rates of gene-gene interactions. Fuzzy-MDR is expanded by a maximum likelihood estimator as a new membership function in empirical fuzzy MDR (EFMDR). However, EFMDR is relatively slow, because it is implemented by R script language. Therefore, in this study, we implemented EFMDR using RCPP (c++ package) for faster executions. Our implementation for faster EFMDR, called EMMDR-Fast, is about 800 times faster than EFMDR written by R script only.\n",

They are membrane proteins that traverse the cytoplasmic membrane seven times and work generally by coupling to heterotrimeric G protein. The OR is a G protein‒coupled receptor that binds the guanine nucleotide-binding Gαolf subunit and the Gβγ dimer to recognize a wide spectrum of organic compounds in accordance with its cognate ligand. Mammalian ORs were originally identified from the olfactory epithelium of rat. However, it has been recently reported that the expression of ORs is not limited to the olfactory organ. In recent decades, they have been found to be expressed in diverse organs or tissues and even tumors in mammals. In this review, the expression and expected function of olfactory receptors that exist throughout an organism’s system are discussed.\n",

We tried to identify genetic variants specifically associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months or older than 5 years of age. We performed an age-stratified genome-wide association study using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 cases vs. 1,000 controls) and a replication study (1,360 cases vs. 3,553 controls) in the Korean population. Among 26 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in replication study, only a rare nonsynonymous SNP (rs4365796: c.1106C＞T, p.Thr369Met) in the lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) gene was very significantly associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months of age (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; pcombined = 1.10 × 10-5), whereas no association of the same SNP was observed in any other age group of KD patients. The same SNP (rs4365796) in the LEF1 gene showed the same direction of risk effect in Japanese KD patients younger than 6 months of age, although the effect was not statistically significant (OR, 1.42; p = 0.397). This result indicates that the LEF1 gene may play an important role as a susceptibility gene specifically affecting KD patients younger than 6 months of age.\n"

With over 164 million reported cases per annum, shigellosis accounts for 1.1 million deaths each year. Majority of these cases occur among the children of the developing nations and the emergence of multi-drug resistance Shigella strains in clinical isolates demands the development of better/new drugs against this pathogen. The genome of Shigella flexneri was extensively analyzed and found 4,362 proteins among which the functions of 674 proteins, termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs) had not been previously elucidated. Amino acid sequences of all these 674 HPs were studied and the functions of a total of 39 HPs have been assigned with high level of confidence. Here we have utilized a combination of the latest versions of databases to assign the precise function of HPs for which no experimental information is available. These HPs were found to belong to various classes of proteins such as enzymes, binding proteins, signal transducers, lipoprotein, transporters, virulence and other proteins. Evaluation of the performance of the various computational tools conducted using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and a resoundingly high average accuracy of 93.6% were obtained.

However, it is still unknown how much of the genetic alterations identified in primary tumors are consistently detected in tumor tissues in the PDX model. In this study, we analyzed the genetic alterations of three primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) and matched xenograft tissues in PDX models using a next-generation sequencing cancer panel. Of the 17 somatic mutations identified from the three CRCs, 14 (82.4%) were consistently identified in both primary and xenograft tumors. The other three mutations identified in the primary tumor were not detected in the xenograft tumor tissue. There was no newly identified mutation in the xenograft tumor tissues. In addition to the somatic mutations, the copy number alteration profiles were also largely consistent between the primary tumor and xenograft tissue. All of these data suggest that the PDX tumor model preserves the majority of the key mutations detected in the primary tumor site. This study provides evidence that the PDX model is useful for testing targeted therapies in the clinical field and research on precision medicine.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The common characteristic of survival analysis is that it contains “censored” data, in which the time to event cannot be completely observed, but instead represents the lower bound of the time to event. Only the occurrence of either time to event or censoring time is observed. Many traditional statistical methods have been effectively used for analyzing survival data with censored observations. However, with the development of high-throughput technologies for producing “omics” data, more advanced statistical methods, such as regularization, should be required to construct the predictive survival model with high-dimensional genomic data. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have been adapted for survival analysis, to fit nonlinear and complex interaction effects between predictors, and achieve more accurate prediction of individual survival probability. Presently, since most clinicians and medical researchers can easily assess statistical programs for analyzing survival data, a review article is helpful for understanding statistical methods used in survival analysis.

During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response.

We conducted a GWAS and surveyed the gene ontology (GO) terms associated with the backfat thickness (BF) trait of these pigs. We included the breed information (Yorkshire and Landrace pigs) as a covariate. The significant genes after false discovery rate (<0.01) correction were AFG1L, SCAI, RIMS1, and SPDEF. The major GO terms for the top 5% of genes were related to neuronal genes, cell morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization. The neuronal genes were previously reported as being associated with backfat thickness. However, the genes in our results were novel, and they included ZNF280D, BAIAP2, LRTM2, GABRA5, PCDH15, HERC1, DTNBP1, SLIT2, TRAPPC9, NGFR, APBB2, RBPJ, and ABL2. These novel genes might have roles in important cellular and physiological functions related to BF accumulation. The genes related to cell morphogenesis were NOX4, MKLN1, ZNF280D, BAIAP2, DNAAF1, LRTM2, PCDH15, NGFR, RBPJ, MYH9, APBB2, DTNBP1, TRIM62, and SLIT2. The genes that belonged to actin cytoskeleton organization were MKLN1, BAIAP2, PCDH15, BCAS3, MYH9, DTNBP1, ABL2, ADD2, and SLIT2.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'MicroRNAs in Autoimmune Sjögren’s Syndrome\\n\\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs), small non-coding RNAs, have been implicated in various diseases and cellular functions as microregulators of gene expression. Although the history of miRNA investigation in autoimmune Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS) is fairly short, a substantial amount of data has already been accumulated. These findings clearly indicate potential clinical implications of miRNAs, such as autoantigen expression and autoantibody production, viral miRNAs regulating the calcium signaling pathway, and aberrant immune cell regulation and cytokine production. Research endeavors in the field are currently underway to select disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by utilizing different types of tissues or biological specimens of SjS patients. Various techniques for miRNA analysis with different stringencies have been applied, with the most recent one being next-generation sequencing. This review compiles and highlights differentially-expressed miRNAs in various samples collected from SjS patients and their potential implications in the pathogenesis of SjS. To facilitate the development of miRNA-targeted personalized therapy in the future, we urge more follow-up studies that confirm these findings and elucidate the immunopathological roles of differentially-expressed miRNAs. Furthermore, improved diagnostic criteria for the disease itself will minimize sampling errors in patient recruitment, preventing the generation of inconsistent data.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Identification of Viral Taxon-Specific Genes (VTSG): Application to Caliciviridae\\n\\nVirus taxonomy was initially determined by clinical experiments based on phenotype. However, with the development of sequence analysis methods, genotype-based classification was also applied. With the development of genome sequence analysis technology, there is an increasing demand for virus taxonomy to be extended from in vivo and in vitro to in silico. In this study, we verified the consistency of the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses taxonomy using an in silico approach, aiming to identify the specific sequence for each virus. We applied this approach to norovirus in Caliciviridae, which causes 90% of gastroenteritis cases worldwide. First, based on the dogma “protein structure determines its function,” we hypothesized that the specific sequence can be identified by the specific structure. Firstly, we extracted the coding region (CDS). Secondly, the CDS protein sequences of each genus were annotated by the conserved domain database (CDD) search. Finally, the conserved domains of each genus in Caliciviridae are classified by RPS-BLAST with CDD. The analysis result is that Caliciviridae has sequences including RNA helicase in common. In case of Norovirus, Calicivirus coat protein C terminal and viral polyprotein N-terminal appears as a specific domain in Caliciviridae. It does not include in the other genera in Caliciviridae. If this method is utilized to detect specific conserved domains, it can be used as classification keywords based on protein functional structure. After determining the specific protein domains, the specific protein domain sequences would be converted to gene sequences. This sequences would be re-used one of viral bio-marks.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'A Universal Analysis Pipeline for Hybrid Capture-Based Targeted Sequencing Data with Unique Molecular Indexes\\n\\nHybrid capture-based targeted sequencing is being used increasingly for genomic variant profiling in tumor patients. Unique molecular index (UMI) technology has recently been developed and helps to increase the accuracy of variant calling by minimizing polymerase chain reaction biases and sequencing errors. However, UMI-adopted targeted sequencing data analysis is slightly different from the methods for other types of omics data, and its pipeline for variant calling is still being optimized in various study groups for their own purposes. Due to this provincial usage of tools, our group built an analysis pipeline for global application to many studies of targeted sequencing generated with different methods. First, we generated hybrid capture-based data using genomic DNA extracted from tumor tissues of colorectal cancer patients. Sequencing libraries were prepared and pooled together, and an 8-plexed capture library was processed to the enrichment step before 150-bp paired-end sequencing with Illumina HiSeq series. For the analysis, we evaluated several published tools. We focused mainly on the compatibility of the input and output of each tool. Finally, our laboratory built an analysis pipeline specialized for UMI-adopted data. Through this pipeline, we were able to estimate even on-target rates and filtered consensus reads for more accurate variant calling. These results suggest the potential of our analysis pipeline in the precise examination of the quality and efficiency of conducted experiments.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Many previous studies have already proposed software to analyze GGI, but most methods focus on a binary phenotype in a case-control design. In this study, we developed “Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis of Gene-Gene Interactions” (HisCoM-GGI) software for GGI analysis with a continuous phenotype. The HisCoM-GGI method considers hierarchical structural relationships between genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enabling both gene-level and SNP-level interaction analysis in a single model. Furthermore, this software accepts various types of genomic data and supports data management and multithreading to improve the efficiency of genome-wide association study data analysis. We expect that HisCoM-GGI software will provide advanced accessibility to researchers in genetic interaction studies and a more effective way to understand biological mechanisms of complex diseases.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

In this study, high-quality de novo assemblies of blood transcriptomes from these penguins were generated using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 22.2 and 21.8 raw reads were obtained from chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively. These reads were assembled using the Oases assembly platform and resulted in 26,036 and 21,854 contigs with N50 values of 929 and 933 base pairs, respectively. Functional gene annotations through pathway analyses of the Gene Ontology, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were performed for each blood transcriptome, resulting in a similar compositional order between the two transcriptomes. Ortholog comparisons with previously published transcriptomes from the Adélie (P. adeliae) and emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins revealed that a high proportion of the four penguins’ transcriptomes had significant sequence homology. Because blood and tissues of penguins have been used to monitor pollution in Antarctica, immune parameters in blood could be important indicators for understanding the health status of penguins and other Antarctic animals. In the blood transcriptomes, KEGG analyses detected many essential genes involved in the major innate immunity pathways, which are key metabolic pathways for maintaining homeostasis against exogenous infections or toxins. Blood transcriptome studies such as this may be useful for checking the immune and health status of penguins without sacrifice.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

However, they play an important role in many cellular processes including trans-differentiation into type I cells as well as repair of lung injury in response to toxic chemicals and respiratory pathogens. Transcription factors are the regulatory proteins dynamically modulating DNA structure and gene expression. Transcription factor profiling in microarray datasets revealed that several members of AP1, ATF, NF-kB, and C/EBP families involved in diverse responses were expressed in mouse lung type II cells. A transcriptional factor signature consisting of Cebpa, Srebf1, Stat3, Klf5, and Elf3 was identified in lung type II cells, Sox9+ pluripotent lung stem cells as well as in mouse lung development. Identification of the transcription factor profile in mouse lung type II cells will serve as a useful resource and facilitate the integrated analysis of signal transduction pathways and specific gene targets in a variety of physiological conditions.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms. This article briefly overviews diagnostic approaches and discusses current issues relating to NC serodiagnosis.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Several studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs are directly or indirectly involved in a variety of biological processes and in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, lncRNAs have important roles in many diseases including cancer. It has been shown that abnormal expression of lncRNAs is observed in several human solid tumors. Several studies have shown that many lncRNAs can function as oncogenes in cancer development through the induction of cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and invasion, anti-apoptosis, and metastasis. Oncogenic lncRNAs have the potential to become promising biomarkers and might be potent prognostic targets in cancer therapy. However, the biological and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA involvement in tumorigenesis have not yet been fully elucidated.

The heritability of an athlete status was reported to be about 70% in a twin study, and at least 155 genetic markers are known to be related with athlete status. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential proteins for oxidative phosphorylation, which is related to aerobic capacity. Thus, mtDNA is a candidate marker for determining physical performance. Recent studies have suggested that polymorphisms of mtDNA are associated with athlete status and/or physical performance in various populations. Therefore, we analyzed mtDNA haplogroups to assess their association with the physical performance of Korean population. The 20 mtDNA haplogroups were determined using the SNaPshot assay. Our result showed a significant association of the haplogroup F with athlete status (odds ratio, 3.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.094 to 8.464; p = 0.012). Athletes with haplogroup F (60.64 ± 3.04) also demonstrated a higher Sargent jump than athletes with other haplogroups (54.28 ± 1.23) (p = 0.041). Thus, our data imply that haplogroup F may play a crucial role in the physical performance of Korean athletes. Functional studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to further substantiate these findings.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Information on known mRNA targets provided by TargetScan is used to perform HisCoM-mimi. However, multiple databases can be used to find miRNA-mRNA signatures with known biological information through different algorithms. To take these additional databases into account, we present our advanced application software for HisCoM-mimi for binary phenotypes. The proposed HisCoM-mimi supports both TargetScan and miRTarBase, which provides manually-verified information initially gathered by text-mining the literature. By integrating information from miRTarBase into HisCoM-mimi, a broad range of target information derived from the research literature can be analyzed. Another improvement of the new HisCoM-mimi approach is the inclusion of updated algorithms to provide the lasso and elastic-net penalties for users who want to fit a model with a smaller number of selected miRNAs and mRNAs. We expect that our HisCoM-mimi software will make advanced methods accessible to researchers who want to identify miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs related with binary phenotypes.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data have been the most useful source for identification of fusion transcripts. Although a number of algorithms have been developed thus far, most programs produce too many false-positives, thus making experimental confirmation almost impossible. We still lack a reliable program that achieves high precision with reasonable recall rate. Here, we present FusionScan, a highly optimized tool for predicting fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data. We specifically search for split reads composed of intact exons at the fusion boundaries. Using 269 known fusion cases as the reference, we have implemented various mapping and filtering strategies to remove false-positives without discarding genuine fusions. In the performance test using three cell line datasets with validated fusion cases (NCI-H660, K562, and MCF-7), FusionScan outperformed other existing programs by a considerable margin, achieving the precision and recall rates of 60% and 79%, respectively. Simulation test also demonstrated that FusionScan recovered most of true positives without producing an overwhelming number of false-positives regardless of sequencing depth and read length. The computation time was comparable to other leading tools. We also provide several curative means to help users investigate the details of fusion candidates easily. We believe that FusionScan would be a reliable, efficient and convenient program for detecting fusion transcripts that meet the requirements in the clinical and experimental community.

In this paper, data points are heterogeneous sets of biosequences (composite data points). A composite data point is a set of ordinary data points (e.g., set of feature vectors). We theoretically extend the derivation of the largest generalized eigenvalue-based distance metric Dij (γ1) in any linear and non-linear feature spaces. We prove that Dij (γ1) is a metric under any linear and non-linear feature transformation function. We show the sufficiency and efficiency of using the decision rule δΞi (i.e., mean of Dij (γ1)) in classification of heterogeneous sets of biosequences compared with the decision rules minΞi and medianΞi. We analyze the impact of linear and non-linear transformation functions on classifying/clustering collections of heterogeneous sets of biosequences. The impact of the length of a sequence in a heterogeneous sequence-set generated by simulation on the classification and clustering results in linear and non-linear feature spaces is empirically shown in this paper. We propose a new concept: the limiting dispersion map of the existing clusters in heterogeneous sets of biosequences embedded in linear and nonlinear feature spaces, which is based on the limiting distribution of nucleotide compositions estimated from real data sets.

While structured databases are supposed to supply readily machine-readable data, unstructured contents, particularly scientific literature, are recognized as a biggest source of data with comprehensive details, e.g., experimental environments and actual observations.\\nSince the importance of scientific literature for data science has been widely recognized, several groups have invested to develop various text mining resources. While many of them are publicly available, interoperability of them remains a critical issue, hindering efficient use or reuse of them, particularly in mix with others.\\nThe Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH) series is annually organized to join forces of biomedical text mining for the goal to promote interoperability among text mining resources. The sixth edition of it was held in Tokyo, February 4-7, 2020, with 52 participants from 9 countries. The first day was held as a symposium to exchange and publicise the activities and ideas of the participants, and the following three days was held as a hackathon: the participants worked on implementing their ideas with collaboration with other participants.\\nWhile the main theme of the event was improving interoperability of biomedical literature mining, which include annotation datasets, tools, platforms, terminology resources, and so on, this year, “social media mining” was also explored as a special theme. Social media is recognized as a good source of raw signals on how people are thinking about what is going on in the world, which are largely missing in scientific literature. Therefore, social media mining is expected to complement literature mining.\\nThis special issue is a collection of the reports on achievements from the hackathon, which address various issues of biomedical literature and social media mining, including document collection, automatic annotation, manual annotation, annotation platform, translation, terminology, ontology, and so on.

Due to the development of next-generation sequencing and the accompanying bioinformatics analysis pipelines, a reconstruction of the classification system has been proposed. At a meeting held in Boston, USA between June 9-11, 2016, there was even an in-depth discussion regarding the classification of viruses using metagenomic data. One suggested activity that arose from the meeting was that viral taxonomy should be reconstructed, based on genotype and bioinformatics analysis “in silico.” This article describes our efforts to achieve this goal by construction of a web-based system and the extension of an associated database, based on ICTV taxonomy. This virus taxonomy web system was designed specifically to extend the virus taxonomy up to strain and isolation, which was then connected with the NCBI database to facilitate searches for specific viral genes; there are also links to journals provided by the EMBL RESTful API that improves accessibility for academic groups.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Utility of Integrated Analysis of Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacometabolomics in Early Phase Clinical Trial: A Case Study of a New Molecular Entity\\n\\nIn this report, we present a case study of how pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics can be useful to characterize safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in early phase new drug development clinical trials. During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Circulating HOTAIR LncRNA Is Potentially Up-regulated in Coronary Artery Disease\\n\\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death and disability all around the world. Recent studies have revealed that aberrantly regulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as one of the main classes of cellular transcript plays a key regulatory role in transcriptional and epigenetic pathways. Recent reports have demonstrated that circulating lncRNAs in the blood can be potential biomarkers for CAD. HOTAIR is one of the most cited lncRNAs with a critical role in the initiation and progression of the gene expression regulation. Recent research on the role of the HOTAIR in cardiovascular disease lays the basis for the development of new studies considering this lncRNA as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAD. In this study, we aimed to compare the expression of HOTAIR lncRNA in the blood samples of patients with CAD and control samples. The expression level was examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. Our data shows that expression of HOTAIR is up-regulated in blood samples of patients with CAD.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Deep learning for stage prediction in neuroblastoma using gene expression data\\n\\nNeuroblastoma is a major cause of cancer death in early childhood, and its timely and correct diagnosis is critical. Gene expression datasets have recently been considered as a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and subtype classification. However, no attempts have yet been made to apply deep learning using gene expression to neuroblastoma classification, although deep learning has been applied to cancer diagnosis using image data. Taking the International Neuroblastoma Staging System stages as multiple classes, we designed a deep neural network using the gene expression patterns and stages of neuroblastoma patients. Despite a small patient population (n = 280), stage 1 and 4 patients were well distinguished. If it is possible to replicate this approach in a larger population, deep learning could play an important role in neuroblastoma staging.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Choosing preferable labels for the Japanese translation of the Human Phenotype Ontology\\n\\nThe Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is the de facto standard ontology to describe human phenotypes in detail, and it is actively used, particularly in the field of rare disease diagnoses. For clinicians who are not fluent in English, the HPO has been translated into many languages, and there have been four initiatives to develop Japanese translations. At the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6), a rule-based approach was attempted to determine the preferable Japanese translation for each HPO term among the candidates developed by the four approaches. The relationship between the HPO and Mammalian Phenotype translations was also investigated, with the eventual goal of harmonizing the two translations to facilitate phenotype-based comparisons of species in Japanese through cross-species phenotype matching. In order to deal with the increase in the number of HPO terms and the need for manual curation, it would be useful to have a dictionary containing word-by-word correspondences and fixed translation phrases for English word order. These considerations seem applicable to HPO localization into other languages.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Mutation Analysis of Synthetic DNA Barcodes in a Fission Yeast Gene Deletion Library by Sanger Sequencing\\n\\nIncorporation of unique barcodes into fission yeast gene deletion collections has enabled the identification of gene functions by growth fitness analysis. For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Identification of ERBB Pathway-Activated Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer\\n\\nIntratumor heterogeneity within a single tumor mass is one of the hallmarks of malignancy and has been reported in various tumor types. The molecular characterization of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a public resource, an ERBB pathway activated triple-negative cell population was identified. The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Integration of the PubAnnotation ecosystem in the development of a web-based search tool for alternative methods\\n\\nFinding publications that propose alternative methods to animal experiments is an important but time-consuming task since researchers need to perform various queries to literature databases and screen many articles to assess two important aspects: the relevance of the article to the research question, and whether the article’s proposed approach qualifies to being an alternative method. We are currently developing a Web application to support finding alternative methods to animal experiments. The current (under development) version of the application utilizes external tools and resources for document processing, and relies on the PubAnnotation ecosystem for annotation querying, annotation storage, dictionary-based tagging of cell lines, and annotation visualization. Currently, our two PubAnnotation repositories for discourse elements contain annotations for more than 110k PubMed documents. Further, we created an annotator for cell lines that contain more than 196k terms from Cellosaurus. Finally, we are experimenting with TextAE for annotation visualization and for user feedback.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Extending TextAE for annotation of non-contiguous entities\\n\\nNamed entity recognition tools are used to identify mentions of biomedical entities in free text and are essential components of high-quality information retrieval and extraction systems. Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity “type 1 diabetes” in the phrase “type 1 and type 2 diabetes.” This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE’s existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Advances in Serological Diagnosis of Taenia solium Neurocysticercosis in Korea\\n\\nCysticercosis, a parasitic disease caused by Taenia solium metacestode (TsM), has a major global public health impact in terms of disability-adjusted life years. The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms. This article briefly overviews diagnostic approaches and discusses current issues relating to NC serodiagnosis.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative combines over 100 controlled vocabularies into its own. However, the OHDSI vocabulary is limited in the sense that it combines multiple terminologies and does not provide a direct way to link them outside of their own self-contained scope. This issue makes the tasks of enriching feature sets by using external resources extremely difficult. In order to address these shortcomings, we have created a linked data version of the OHDSI vocabulary, connecting it with already established linked resources like bioportal, bio2rdf, etc. with the ultimate purpose of enabling the interoperability of resources previously foreign to the OHDSI universe.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Improving accessibility and distinction between negative results in biomedical relation extraction\\n\\nAccessible negative results are relevant for researchers and clinicians not only to limit their search space but also to prevent the costly re-exploration of research hypotheses. However, most biomedical relation extraction datasets do not seek to distinguish between a false and a negative relation among two biomedical entities. Furthermore, datasets created using distant supervision techniques also have some false negative relations that constitute undocumented/unknown relations (missing from a knowledge base). We propose to improve the distinction between these concepts, by revising a subset of the relations marked as false on the phenotype-gene relations corpus and give the first steps to automatically distinguish between the false (F), negative (N), and unknown (U) results. Our work resulted in a sample of 127 manually annotated FNU relations and a weighted-F1 of 0.5609 for their automatic distinction.

Particularly in metagenomics, which identifies the composition of microorganisms using thousands of sequences, its importance is even greater. Identification is inevitably affected by the choice of database. This study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of three widely used 16S databases—Greengenes, Silva, and EzBioCloud—and to suggest basic guidelines for selecting reference databases. Using public mock community data, each database was used to assign taxonomy and to test its accuracy.

              " 'EFMDR-Fast: An Application of Empirical Fuzzy Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction for Fast Execution\\n\\nGene-gene interaction is a key factor for explaining missing heritability. Many methods have been proposed to identify gene-gene interactions. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a well-known method for the detection of gene-gene interactions by reduction from genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism combinations to a binary variable with a value of high risk or low risk. This method has been widely expanded to own a specific objective. Among those expansions, fuzzy-MDR uses the fuzzy set theory for the membership of high risk or low risk and increases the detection rates of gene-gene interactions. Fuzzy-MDR is expanded by a maximum likelihood estimator as a new membership function in empirical fuzzy MDR (EFMDR). However, EFMDR is relatively slow, because it is implemented by R script language. Therefore, in this study, we implemented EFMDR using RCPP (c++ package) for faster executions. Our implementation for faster EFMDR, called EMMDR-Fast, is about 800 times faster than EFMDR written by R script only.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'System-Wide Expression and Function of Olfactory Receptors in Mammals\\n\\nOlfactory receptors (ORs) in mammals are generally considered to function as chemosensors in the olfactory organs of animals. They are membrane proteins that traverse the cytoplasmic membrane seven times and work generally by coupling to heterotrimeric G protein. The OR is a G protein‒coupled receptor that binds the guanine nucleotide-binding Gαolf subunit and the Gβγ dimer to recognize a wide spectrum of organic compounds in accordance with its cognate ligand. Mammalian ORs were originally identified from the olfactory epithelium of rat. However, it has been recently reported that the expression of ORs is not limited to the olfactory organ. In recent decades, they have been found to be expressed in diverse organs or tissues and even tumors in mammals. In this review, the expression and expected function of olfactory receptors that exist throughout an organism’s system are discussed.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The dominant incidence age of KD is from 6 months to 5 years of age, and the incidence is unusual in those younger than 6 months and older than 5 years of age. We tried to identify genetic variants specifically associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months or older than 5 years of age. We performed an age-stratified genome-wide association study using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 cases vs. 1,000 controls) and a replication study (1,360 cases vs. 3,553 controls) in the Korean population. Among 26 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in replication study, only a rare nonsynonymous SNP (rs4365796: c.1106C＞T, p.Thr369Met) in the lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) gene was very significantly associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months of age (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; pcombined = 1.10 × 10-5), whereas no association of the same SNP was observed in any other age group of KD patients. The same SNP (rs4365796) in the LEF1 gene showed the same direction of risk effect in Japanese KD patients younger than 6 months of age, although the effect was not statistically significant (OR, 1.42; p = 0.397). This result indicates that the LEF1 gene may play an important role as a susceptibility gene specifically affecting KD patients younger than 6 months of age.\\n BREAKS HERE']"

The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has boosted microbiome research through the study of microbial genomes and allowing a more precise quantification of microbiome abundances and function. Microbiome data analysis is challenging because it involves high-dimensional structured multivariate sparse data and because of its compositional nature. In this review we outline some of the procedures that are most commonly used for microbiome analysis and that are implemented in R packages. We place particular emphasis on the compositional structure of microbiome data. We describe the principles of compositional data analysis and distinguish between standard methods and those that fit into compositional data analysis.\n",

            "Metritis, the inflammation of the uterus caused by polymicrobial infections, is a prevalent and costly disease to the dairy industry as it decreases milk yield, survival, and the welfare of dairy cows. Although affected cows are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftiofur, endometrial and ovarian function are not fully recovered, which results in subfertility and infertility. According to culture-dependent studies, uterine pathogens include Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Prevotella melaninogenica. Recent studies using high-throughput sequencing observed very low relative abundance of Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, and Prevotella melaninogenica in cows with metritis. Herein, we propose that metritis is associated with a dysbiosis of the uterine microbiota, which is characterized by high abundance\n",

Genes play a role in almost half of all cases of hearing loss but effective treatment options are very limited. Genetic hearing loss is considered to be extremely genetically heterogeneous. The advancements in genomics have been instrumental to the identification of more than 6,000 causative variants in more than 150 genes causing hearing loss. Identification of genes for hearing impairment provides an increased insight into the normal development and function of cells in the auditory system. These defective genes will ultimately be important therapeutic targets. However, the auditory system is extremely complex which requires tremendous advances in gene therapy including gene vectors, routes of administration, and therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes and discusses recent advances in elucidating the genomics of genetic hearing loss and technologies aimed at developing a gene therapy that may become a treatment option for in the near future.\n",

            "Shigella spp. constitutes some of the key pathogens responsible for the global burden of diarrhoeal disease. With over 164 million reported cases per annum, shigellosis accounts for 1.1 million deaths each year. Majority of these cases occur among the children of the developing nations and the emergence of multi-drug resistance Shigella strains in clinical isolates demands the development of better/new drugs against this pathogen. The genome of Shigella flexneri was extensively analyzed and found 4,362 proteins among which the functions of 674 proteins, termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs) had not been previously elucidated. Amino acid sequences of all these 674 HPs were studied and the functions of a total of 39 HPs have been assigned with high level of confidence. Here we have utilized a combination of the latest versions of databases to assign the precise function of HPs for which no experimental information is available. These HPs were found to belong to various classes of proteins such as enzymes, binding proteins, signal transducers, lipoprotein, transporters, virulence and other proteins. Evaluation of the performance of the various computational tools conducted using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and a resoundingly high average accuracy of 93.6% were obtained. Our comprehensive analysis will help to gain greater understanding for the development of many novel potential therapeutic interventions to defeat Shigella infection.\n",

The approach is based on two components: undirected graph and Mosaab-metric space. The significant application of this approach is to visualize the segmented genome of a virus. We use Influenza and Ebola viruses as examples to demonstrate the robustness of this approach and to conduct comparisons. This approach can provide researchers with deep insights about information structures extracted from a segmented genome as a composite biodata point, and consequently, to capture the segmented genetic variations and diversity (variants) in composite data points.\n",

            "\n",
            "Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are useful tools for tumor biology research and testing the efficacy of candidate anticancer drugs targeting the druggable mutations identified in tumor tissue. However, it is still unknown how much of the genetic alterations identified in primary tumors are consistently detected in tumor tissues in the PDX model. In this study, we analyzed the genetic alterations of three primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) and matched xenograft tissues in PDX models using a next-generation sequencing cancer panel. Of the 17 somatic mutations identified from the three CRCs, 14 (82.4%) were consistently identified in both primary and xenograft tumors. The other three mutations identified in the primary tumor were not detected in the xenograft tumor tissue. There was no newly identified mutation in the xenograft tumor tissues. In addition to the somatic mutations, the copy number alteration profiles were also largely consistent between the primary tumor and xenograft tissue. All of these data suggest that the PDX tumor model preserves the majority of the key mutations detected in the primary tumor site. This study provides evidence that the PDX model is useful for testing targeted therapies in the clinical field and research on precision medicine.\n",

            "Intratumor heterogeneity within a single tumor mass is one of the hallmarks of malignancy and has been reported in various tumor types. The molecular characterization of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a public resource, an ERBB pathway activated triple-negative cell population was identified. The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.\n",

In this study, we compared the performance of two major sequencers (MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000) to test whether the MGISEQ-2000 sequencer delivers high-quality sequence data as suggested. We performed RNA sequencing of four human colon cancer samples with the two platforms, and compared the sequencing quality and expression values. The data produced from the MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000 showed high concordance, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. Various quality control (QC) analyses showed that the MGISEQ-2000 data fulfilled the required QC measures. Our study suggests that the performance of the MGISEQ-2000 is comparable to that of the HiSeq 4000 and that the MGISEQ-2000 can be a useful platform for sequencing.\n",

            "\n",
            "Survival analysis mainly deals with the time to event, including death, onset of disease, and bankruptcy. The common characteristic of survival analysis is that it contains “censored” data, in which the time to event cannot be completely observed, but instead represents the lower bound of the time to event. Only the occurrence of either time to event or censoring time is observed. Many traditional statistical methods have been effectively used for analyzing survival data with censored observations. However, with the development of high-throughput technologies for producing “omics” data, more advanced statistical methods, such as regularization, should be required to construct the predictive survival model with high-dimensional genomic data. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have been adapted for survival analysis, to fit nonlinear and complex interaction effects between predictors, and achieve more accurate prediction of individual survival probability. Presently, since most clinicians and medical researchers can easily assess statistical programs for analyzing survival data, a review article is helpful for understanding statistical methods used in survival analysis. We review traditional survival methods and regularization methods, with various penalty functions, for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics, and describe machine learning techniques that have been adapted to survival analysis.\n",

These are the most extensively used drugs for treating bacterial infections in the field of both human and veterinary medicine. Herein, the antibacterial and pharmacological properties of four fluoroquinolones: lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin have been studied. The objective of this study was to analyze the antibacterial characteristics of the different fluoroquinolones. Also, the pharmacological properties of the compounds including the Lipinski rule of five, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, LD50, drug likeliness, and toxicity were evaluated. We found that among all four FQ molecules, ofloxacin showed the highest antibacterial activity through in silico assays with a strong interaction (−38.52 kJ/mol) with the antibacterial target protein (topoisomerase-II DNA gyrase enzyme). The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic analysis also showed that the compounds ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and norfloxacin have good pharmacological properties. Notably, ofloxacin was found to possess an IGC50 (concentration needed to inhibit 50% growth) value of 0.286 μg/L against the Tetrahymena pyriformis protozoa. It also tested negative for the Ames toxicity test, showing its non-carcinogenic character.\n",

            "Incorporation of unique barcodes into fission yeast gene deletion collections has enabled the identification of gene functions by growth fitness analysis. For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.\n",

During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.\n",

Landrace and Yorkshire pigs are important pork-providing breeds. Although quantitative trait loci of pigs are well-developed, significant genes in GWASs of pigs in Korea must be studied. Through a GWAS using the PLINK program, study of the significant genes in Korean pigs was performed. We conducted a GWAS and surveyed the gene ontology (GO) terms associated with the backfat thickness (BF) trait of these pigs. We included the breed information (Yorkshire and Landrace pigs) as a covariate. The significant genes after false discovery rate (<0.01) correction were AFG1L, SCAI, RIMS1, and SPDEF. The major GO terms for the top 5% of genes were related to neuronal genes, cell morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization. The neuronal genes were previously reported as being associated with backfat thickness. However, the genes in our results were novel, and they included ZNF280D, BAIAP2, LRTM2, GABRA5, PCDH15, HERC1, DTNBP1, SLIT2, TRAPPC9, NGFR, APBB2, RBPJ, and ABL2. These novel genes might have roles in important cellular and physiological functions related to BF accumulation.

Although the history of miRNA investigation in autoimmune Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS) is fairly short, a substantial amount of data has already been accumulated. These findings clearly indicate potential clinical implications of miRNAs, such as autoantigen expression and autoantibody production, viral miRNAs regulating the calcium signaling pathway, and aberrant immune cell regulation and cytokine production. Research endeavors in the field are currently underway to select disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by utilizing different types of tissues or biological specimens of SjS patients. Various techniques for miRNA analysis with different stringencies have been applied, with the most recent one being next-generation sequencing. This review compiles and highlights differentially-expressed miRNAs in various samples collected from SjS patients and their potential implications in the pathogenesis of SjS. To facilitate the development of miRNA-targeted personalized therapy in the future, we urge more follow-up studies that confirm these findings and elucidate the immunopathological roles of differentially-expressed miRNAs. Furthermore, improved diagnostic criteria for the disease itself will minimize sampling errors in patient recruitment, preventing the generation of inconsistent data.\n",

            "Virus taxonomy was initially determined by clinical experiments based on phenotype. However, with the development of sequence analysis methods, genotype-based classification was also applied. With the development of genome sequence analysis technology, there is an increasing demand for virus taxonomy to be extended from in vivo and in vitro to in silico. In this study, we verified the consistency of the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses taxonomy using an in silico approach, aiming to identify the specific sequence for each virus. We applied this approach to norovirus in Caliciviridae, which causes 90% of gastroenteritis cases worldwide. First, based on the dogma “protein structure determines its function,” we hypothesized that the specific sequence can be identified by the specific structure. Firstly, we extracted the coding region (CDS). Secondly, the CDS protein sequences of each genus were annotated by the conserved domain database (CDD) search. Finally, the conserved domains of each genus in Caliciviridae are classified by RPS-BLAST with CDD. The analysis result is that Caliciviridae has sequences including RNA helicase in common. In case of Norovirus, Calicivirus coat protein C terminal and viral polyprotein N-terminal appears as a specific domain in Caliciviridae. It does not include in the other genera in Caliciviridae. If this method is utilized to detect specific conserved domains, it can be used as classification keywords based on protein functional structure. After determining the specific protein domains, the specific protein domain sequences would be converted to gene sequences. This sequences would be re-used one of viral bio-marks.\n",

            "Hybrid capture-based targeted sequencing is being used increasingly for genomic variant profiling in tumor patients. Unique molecular index (UMI) technology has recently been developed and helps to increase the accuracy of variant calling by minimizing polymerase chain reaction biases and sequencing errors. However, UMI-adopted targeted sequencing data analysis is slightly different from the methods for other types of omics data, and its pipeline for variant calling is still being optimized in various study groups for their own purposes. Due to this provincial usage of tools, our group built an analysis pipeline for global application to many studies of targeted sequencing generated with different methods. First, we generated hybrid capture-based data using genomic DNA extracted from tumor tissues of colorectal cancer patients. Sequencing libraries were prepared and pooled together, and an 8-plexed capture library was processed to the enrichment step before 150-bp paired-end sequencing with Illumina HiSeq series. For the analysis, we evaluated several published tools. We focused mainly on the compatibility of the input and output of each tool. Finally, our laboratory built an analysis pipeline specialized for UMI-adopted data. Through this pipeline, we were able to estimate even on-target rates and filtered consensus reads for more accurate variant calling. These results suggest the potential of our analysis pipeline in the precise examination of the quality and efficiency of conducted experiments.\n",

In this study, we developed “Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis of Gene-Gene Interactions” (HisCoM-GGI) software for GGI analysis with a continuous phenotype. The HisCoM-GGI method considers hierarchical structural relationships between genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enabling both gene-level and SNP-level interaction analysis in a single model. Furthermore, this software accepts various types of genomic data and supports data management and multithreading to improve the efficiency of genome-wide association study data analysis.

In this study, high-quality de novo assemblies of blood transcriptomes from these penguins were generated using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 22.2 and 21.8 raw reads were obtained from chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively. These reads were assembled using the Oases assembly platform and resulted in 26,036 and 21,854 contigs with N50 values of 929 and 933 base pairs, respectively. Functional gene annotations through pathway analyses of the Gene Ontology, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were performed for each blood transcriptome, resulting in a similar compositional order between the two transcriptomes. Ortholog comparisons with previously published transcriptomes from the Adélie (P. adeliae) and emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins revealed that a high proportion of the four penguins’ transcriptomes had significant sequence homology. Because blood and tissues of penguins have been used to monitor pollution in Antarctica, immune parameters in blood could be important indicators for understanding the health status of penguins and other Antarctic animals. In the blood transcriptomes, KEGG analyses detected many essential genes involved in the major innate immunity pathways, which are key metabolic pathways for maintaining homeostasis against exogenous infections or toxins. Blood transcriptome studies such as this may be useful for checking the immune and health status of penguins without sacrifice.\n",

The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential proteins for oxidative phosphorylation, which is related to aerobic capacity. Thus, mtDNA is a candidate marker for determining physical performance. Recent studies have suggested that polymorphisms of mtDNA are associated with athlete status and/or physical performance in various populations. Therefore, we analyzed mtDNA haplogroups to assess their association with the physical performance of Korean population. The 20 mtDNA haplogroups were determined using the SNaPshot assay. Our result showed a significant association of the haplogroup F with athlete status (odds ratio, 3.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.094 to 8.464; p = 0.012). Athletes with haplogroup F (60.64 ± 3.04) also demonstrated a higher Sargent jump than athletes with other haplogroups (54.28 ± 1.23) (p = 0.041).

We still lack a reliable program that achieves high precision with reasonable recall rate. Here, we present FusionScan, a highly optimized tool for predicting fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data. We specifically search for split reads composed of intact exons at the fusion boundaries. Using 269 known fusion cases as the reference, we have implemented various mapping and filtering strategies to remove false-positives without discarding genuine fusions. In the performance test using three cell line datasets with validated fusion cases (NCI-H660, K562, and MCF-7), FusionScan outperformed other existing programs by a considerable margin, achieving the precision and recall rates of 60% and 79%, respectively. Simulation test also demonstrated that FusionScan recovered most of true positives without producing an overwhelming number of false-positives regardless of sequencing depth and read length. The computation time was comparable to other leading tools. We also provide several curative means to help users investigate the details of fusion candidates easily.

In this paper, data points are heterogeneous sets of biosequences (composite data points). A composite data point is a set of ordinary data points (e.g., set of feature vectors). We theoretically extend the derivation of the largest generalized eigenvalue-based distance metric Dij (γ1) in any linear and non-linear feature spaces. We prove that Dij (γ1) is a metric under any linear and non-linear feature transformation function. We show the sufficiency and efficiency of using the decision rule δΞi (i.e., mean of Dij (γ1)) in classification of heterogeneous sets of biosequences compared with the decision rules minΞi and medianΞi. We analyze the impact of linear and non-linear transformation functions on classifying/clustering collections of heterogeneous sets of biosequences. The impact of the length of a sequence in a heterogeneous sequence-set generated by simulation on the classification and clustering results in linear and non-linear feature spaces is empirically shown in this paper. We propose a new concept: the limiting dispersion map of the existing clusters in heterogeneous sets of biosequences embedded in linear and nonlinear feature spaces, which is based on the limiting distribution of nucleotide compositions estimated from real data sets.

During the past decade, genome-wide DNA methylation studies of T2D have expanded our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying T2D. This review summarizes case-control studies of the DNA methylome of T2D and discusses DNA methylation as both a cause and consequence of T2D. Therefore, DNA methylation has potential as a promising T2D biomarker that can be applied to the development of therapeutic strategies for T2D.\n",

            "\n",
            "Phenotyping is a major issue for wheat agriculture to meet the challenges of adaptation of wheat varieties to climate change and chemical input reduction in crop. The need to improve the reuse of observations and experimental data has led to the creation of reference ontologies to standardize descriptions of phenotypes and to facilitate their comparison. The scientific literature is largely under-exploited, although extremely rich in phenotype descriptions associated with cultivars and genetic information. In this paper we propose the Wheat Trait Ontology (WTO) that is suitable for the extraction and management of scientific information from scientific papers, and its combination with data from genomic and experimental databases. We describe the principles of WTO construction and show examples of WTO use for the extraction and management of phenotype descriptions obtained from scientific documents.\n",

While structured databases are supposed to supply readily machine-readable data, unstructured contents, particularly scientific literature, are recognized as a biggest source of data with comprehensive details, e.g., experimental environments and actual observations.\n",
            "Since the importance of scientific literature for data science has been widely recognized, several groups have invested to develop various text mining resources. While many of them are publicly available, interoperability of them remains a critical issue, hindering efficient use or reuse of them, particularly in mix with others.\n",
            "The Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH) series is annually organized to join forces of biomedical text mining for the goal to promote interoperability among text mining resources. The sixth edition of it was held in Tokyo, February 4-7, 2020, with 52 participants from 9 countries. The first day was held as a symposium to exchange and publicise the activities and ideas of the participants, and the following three days was held as a hackathon: the participants worked on implementing their ideas with collaboration with other participants.\n",
            "While the main theme of the event was improving interoperability of biomedical literature mining, which include annotation datasets, tools, platforms, terminology resources, and so on, this year, “social media mining” was also explored as a special theme. Social media is recognized as a good source of raw signals on how people are thinking about what is going on in the world, which are largely missing in scientific literature. Therefore, social media mining is expected to complement literature mining.\n",
            "This special issue is a collection of the reports on achievements from the hackathon, which address various issues of biomedical literature and social media mining, including document collection, automatic annotation, manual annotation, annotation platform, translation, terminology, ontology, and so on. Note that, except a few, many of the works began just before or even during the hackathon, and due to the limited time for work, they are often small-sized works, which are expected to benefit from collaboration with other participants. Readers will find that many of the articles have co-authorship with, or acknowledgment of other participants, which is a typical nature of hackathon-oriented publications.\n",
            "We hope that this will be an opportunity for the readers of the journal Genomics & Informatics to get aware of the state-of-the-art activities regarding interoperability of biomedical text mining, and at the same time to observe activities of hackathons like BLAH.\n",

            "\n",
            "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of progressive lung disease, featured by airflow obstruction. Recently, a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome in lung tissue of COPD patients was performed, but the heterogeneity of the sample was not seriously considered in characterizing the mechanistic dysregulation of COPD. Here, we established a new transcriptome analysis pipeline using a deconvolution process to reduce the heterogeneity and clearly identified that these transcriptome data originated from the mild or moderate stage of COPD patients. Differentially expressed or co-expressed genes in the protein interaction subnetworks were linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune response, as expected. Computational protein localization prediction revealed that 19 proteins showing changes in subcellular localization were mostly related to mitochondria, suggesting that mislocalization of mitochondria-targeting proteins plays an important role in COPD pathology. Our extensive evaluation of COPD transcriptome data could provide guidelines for analyzing heterogeneous gene expression profiles and classifying potential candidate genes that are responsible for the pathogenesis of COPD.\n",

The extra B chromosomes do not affect the host-plant morphology; therefore, whole transcriptome analysis was performed in 0B and 1B plants to identify differentially expressed genes. A total of 154,810 transcripts were obtained from over 10 Gbp data by de novo assembly. By mapping the raw reads to the de novo transcripts, we identified 7,852 differentially expressed genes (log2FC > |10|), in which 4,059 and 3,794 were up-and down-regulated, respectively, in 1B plants compared to 0B plants. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that various differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular processes including the cell cycle, chromosome breakage and repair, and microtubule formation; all of which may be related to the occurrence and maintenance of B chromosomes. Our data provide insight into transcriptomic changes and evolution of plant B chromosomes and deliver an informative database for future study of B chromosome transcriptomes in the Korean lily.\n",

            "The amount of content on social media platforms such as Twitter is expanding rapidly. Simultaneously, the lack of patient information seriously hinders the diagnosis and treatment of rare/intractable diseases. However, these patient communities are especially active on social media. Data from social media could serve as a source of patient-centric knowledge for these diseases complementary to the information collected in clinical settings and patient registries, and may also have potential for research use. To explore this question, we attempted to extract patient-centric knowledge from social media as a task for the 3-day Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6). We selected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis as use cases of rare and intractable diseases, respectively, and we extracted patient histories related to these health conditions from Twitter. Four diagnosed patients for each disease were selected. From the user timelines of these eight patients, we extracted tweets that might be related to health conditions. Based on our experiment, we show that our approach has considerable potential, although we identified problems that should be addressed in future attempts to mine information about rare/intractable diseases from Twitter.\n",

            "There has been a dramatic increase in the popularity of utilizing social media data for research purposes within the biomedical community. In PubMed alone, there have been nearly 2,500 publication entries since 2014 that deal with analyzing social media data from Twitter and Reddit. However, the vast majority of those works do not share their code or data for replicating their studies. With minimal exceptions, the few that do, place the burden on the researcher to figure out how to fetch the data, how to best format their data, and how to create automatic and manual annotations on the acquired data. In order to address this pressing issue, we introduce the Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT), a suite of tools aimed to encapsulate the cumbersome details of acquiring, preprocessing, annotating and standardizing social media data. The purpose of our toolkit is for researchers to focus on answering research questions, and not the technical aspects of using social media data. By using a standard toolkit, researchers will be able to acquire, use, and release data in a consistent way that is transparent for everybody using the toolkit, hence, simplifying research reproducibility and accessibility in the social media domain.\n",

            "\n",
            "In 1966, the International Classification of Viruses (ICNV) was established to standardize the naming of viruses. In 1975, the organization was renamed “International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),” by which it is still known today. The primary virus classification provided by ICTV in 1971 was for viruses infecting vertebrates, which includes 19 genera, 2 families, and 24 unclassified groups. Presently, the 10th virus taxonomy has been published. However, the early classification of viruses was based on clinical results “in vivo” and “in vitro,” as well as on the shape of the Phenotype virus. Due to the development of next-generation sequencing and the accompanying bioinformatics analysis pipelines, a reconstruction of the classification system has been proposed. At a meeting held in Boston, USA between June 9-11, 2016, there was even an in-depth discussion regarding the classification of viruses using metagenomic data. One suggested activity that arose from the meeting was that viral taxonomy should be reconstructed, based on genotype and bioinformatics analysis “in silico.” This article describes our efforts to achieve this goal by construction of a web-based system and the extension of an associated database, based on ICTV taxonomy. This virus taxonomy web system was designed specifically to extend the virus taxonomy up to strain and isolation, which was then connected with the NCBI database to facilitate searches for specific viral genes; there are also links to journals provided by the EMBL RESTful API that improves accessibility for academic groups.\n",

            "In this report, we present a case study of how pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics can be useful to characterize safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in early phase new drug development clinical trials. During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.\n",

            "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death and disability all around the world. Recent studies have revealed that aberrantly regulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as one of the main classes of cellular transcript plays a key regulatory role in transcriptional and epigenetic pathways. Recent reports have demonstrated that circulating lncRNAs in the blood can be potential biomarkers for CAD. HOTAIR is one of the most cited lncRNAs with a critical role in the initiation and progression of the gene expression regulation. Recent research on the role of the HOTAIR in cardiovascular disease lays the basis for the development of new studies considering this lncRNA as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAD. In this study, we aimed to compare the expression of HOTAIR lncRNA in the blood samples of patients with CAD and control samples. The expression level was examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. Our data shows that expression of HOTAIR is up-regulated in blood samples of patients with CAD.\n",

Gene expression datasets have recently been considered as a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and subtype classification. However, no attempts have yet been made to apply deep learning using gene expression to neuroblastoma classification, although deep learning has been applied to cancer diagnosis using image data. Taking the International Neuroblastoma Staging System stages as multiple classes, we designed a deep neural network using the gene expression patterns and stages of neuroblastoma patients. Despite a small patient population (n = 280), stage 1 and 4 patients were well distinguished. If it is possible to replicate this approach in a larger population, deep learning could play an important role in neuroblastoma staging.\n",

            "The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) is the de facto standard ontology to describe human phenotypes in detail, and it is actively used, particularly in the field of rare disease diagnoses. For clinicians who are not fluent in English, the HPO has been translated into many languages, and there have been four initiatives to develop Japanese translations. At the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6), a rule-based approach was attempted to determine the preferable Japanese translation for each HPO term among the candidates developed by the four approaches. The relationship between the HPO and Mammalian Phenotype translations was also investigated, with the eventual goal of harmonizing the two translations to facilitate phenotype-based comparisons of species in Japanese through cross-species phenotype matching. In order to deal with the increase in the number of HPO terms and the need for manual curation, it would be useful to have a dictionary containing word-by-word correspondences and fixed translation phrases for English word order. These considerations seem applicable to HPO localization into other languages.\n",

            "Incorporation of unique barcodes into fission yeast gene deletion collections has enabled the identification of gene functions by growth fitness analysis. For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.\n",

            "Intratumor heterogeneity within a single tumor mass is one of the hallmarks of malignancy and has been reported in various tumor types. The molecular characterization of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a public resource, an ERBB pathway activated triple-negative cell population was identified. The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.\n",

We are currently developing a Web application to support finding alternative methods to animal experiments. The current (under development) version of the application utilizes external tools and resources for document processing, and relies on the PubAnnotation ecosystem for annotation querying, annotation storage, dictionary-based tagging of cell lines, and annotation visualization. Currently, our two PubAnnotation repositories for discourse elements contain annotations for more than 110k PubMed documents. Further, we created an annotator for cell lines that contain more than 196k terms from Cellosaurus. Finally, we are experimenting with TextAE for annotation visualization and for user feedback.\n",

            "Named entity recognition tools are used to identify mentions of biomedical entities in free text and are essential components of high-quality information retrieval and extraction systems. Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity “type 1 diabetes” in the phrase “type 1 and type 2 diabetes.” This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE’s existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems.\n",

            "Cysticercosis, a parasitic disease caused by Taenia solium metacestode (TsM), has a major global public health impact in terms of disability-adjusted life years. The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms. This article briefly overviews diagnostic approaches and discusses current issues relating to NC serodiagnosis.\n",

The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative combines over 100 controlled vocabularies into its own. However, the OHDSI vocabulary is limited in the sense that it combines multiple terminologies and does not provide a direct way to link them outside of their own self-contained scope. This issue makes the tasks of enriching feature sets by using external resources extremely difficult. In order to address these shortcomings, we have created a linked data version of the OHDSI vocabulary, connecting it with already established linked resources like bioportal, bio2rdf, etc. with the ultimate purpose of enabling the interoperability of resources previously foreign to the OHDSI universe.\n",

However, most biomedical relation extraction datasets do not seek to distinguish between a false and a negative relation among two biomedical entities. Furthermore, datasets created using distant supervision techniques also have some false negative relations that constitute undocumented/unknown relations (missing from a knowledge base). We propose to improve the distinction between these concepts, by revising a subset of the relations marked as false on the phenotype-gene relations corpus and give the first steps to automatically distinguish between the false (F), negative (N), and unknown (U) results. Our work resulted in a sample of 127 manually annotated FNU relations and a weighted-F1 of 0.5609 for their automatic distinction.

            "Gene-gene interaction is a key factor for explaining missing heritability. Many methods have been proposed to identify gene-gene interactions. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a well-known method for the detection of gene-gene interactions by reduction from genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism combinations to a binary variable with a value of high risk or low risk. This method has been widely expanded to own a specific objective. Among those expansions, fuzzy-MDR uses the fuzzy set theory for the membership of high risk or low risk and increases the detection rates of gene-gene interactions. Fuzzy-MDR is expanded by a maximum likelihood estimator as a new membership function in empirical fuzzy MDR (EFMDR). However, EFMDR is relatively slow, because it is implemented by R script language. Therefore, in this study, we implemented EFMDR using RCPP (c++ package) for faster executions. Our implementation for faster EFMDR, called EMMDR-Fast, is about 800 times faster than EFMDR written by R script only.\n",

The OR is a G protein‒coupled receptor that binds the guanine nucleotide-binding Gαolf subunit and the Gβγ dimer to recognize a wide spectrum of organic compounds in accordance with its cognate ligand. Mammalian ORs were originally identified from the olfactory epithelium of rat. However, it has been recently reported that the expression of ORs is not limited to the olfactory organ. In recent decades, they have been found to be expressed in diverse organs or tissues and even tumors in mammals. In this review, the expression and expected function of olfactory receptors that exist throughout an organism’s system are discussed.\n",

The dominant incidence age of KD is from 6 months to 5 years of age, and the incidence is unusual in those younger than 6 months and older than 5 years of age. We tried to identify genetic variants specifically associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months or older than 5 years of age. We performed an age-stratified genome-wide association study using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 cases vs. 1,000 controls) and a replication study (1,360 cases vs. 3,553 controls) in the Korean population. Among 26 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in replication study, only a rare nonsynonymous SNP (rs4365796: c.1106C＞T, p.Thr369Met) in the lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) gene was very significantly associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months of age (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; pcombined = 1.10 × 10-5), whereas no association of the same SNP was observed in any other age group of KD patients. The same SNP (rs4365796) in the LEF1 gene showed the same direction of risk effect in Japanese KD patients younger than 6 months of age, although the effect was not statistically significant (OR, 1.42; p = 0.397). This result indicates that the LEF1 gene may play an important role as a susceptibility gene specifically affecting KD patients younger than 6 months of age.\n",

The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has boosted microbiome research through the study of microbial genomes and allowing a more precise quantification of microbiome abundances and function. Microbiome data analysis is challenging because it involves high-dimensional structured multivariate sparse data and because of its compositional nature. In this review we outline some of the procedures that are most commonly used for microbiome analysis and that are implemented in R packages. We place particular emphasis on the compositional structure of microbiome data. We describe the principles of compositional data analysis and distinguish between standard methods and those that fit into compositional data analysis.',\n",

              " 'An Advanced Understanding of Uterine Microbial Ecology Associated with Metritis in Dairy Cows\\n\\nMetritis, the inflammation of the uterus caused by polymicrobial infections, is a prevalent and costly disease to the dairy industry as it decreases milk yield, survival, and the welfare of dairy cows. Although affected cows are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftiofur, endometrial and ovarian function are not fully recovered, which results in subfertility and infertility. According to culture-dependent studies, uterine pathogens include Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Prevotella melaninogenica. Recent studies using high-throughput sequencing observed very low relative abundance of Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, and Prevotella melaninogenica in cows with metritis. Herein, we propose that metritis is associated with a dysbiosis of the uterine microbiota, which is characterized by high abundance',\n",
              " 'Genetic Hearing Loss and Gene Therapy\\n\\nGenetic hearing loss crosses almost all the categories of hearing loss which includes the following: conductive, sensory, and neural; syndromic and nonsyndromic; congenital, progressive, and adult onset; high-frequency, low-frequency, or mixed frequency; mild or profound; and recessive, dominant, or sex-linked. Genes play a role in almost half of all cases of hearing loss but effective treatment options are very limited. Genetic hearing loss is considered to be extremely genetically heterogeneous. The advancements in genomics have been instrumental to the identification of more than 6,000 causative variants in more than 150 genes causing hearing loss. Identification of genes for hearing impairment provides an increased insight into the normal development and function of cells in the auditory system. These defective genes will ultimately be important therapeutic targets. However, the auditory system is extremely complex which requires tremendous advances in gene therapy including gene vectors, routes of administration, and therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes and discusses recent advances in elucidating the genomics of genetic hearing loss and technologies aimed at developing a gene therapy that may become a treatment option for in the near future.',\n",
              " 'Functional Prediction of Hypothetical Proteins from Shigella flexneri and Validation of the Predicted Models by Using ROC Curve Analysis\\n\\nShigella spp. constitutes some of the key pathogens responsible for the global burden of diarrhoeal disease. With over 164 million reported cases per annum, shigellosis accounts for 1.1 million deaths each year. Majority of these cases occur among the children of the developing nations and the emergence of multi-drug resistance Shigella strains in clinical isolates demands the development of better/new drugs against this pathogen. The genome of Shigella flexneri was extensively analyzed and found 4,362 proteins among which the functions of 674 proteins, termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs) had not been previously elucidated. Amino acid sequences of all these 674 HPs were studied and the functions of a total of 39 HPs have been assigned with high level of confidence. Here we have utilized a combination of the latest versions of databases to assign the precise function of HPs for which no experimental information is available. These HPs were found to belong to various classes of proteins such as enzymes, binding proteins, signal transducers, lipoprotein, transporters, virulence and other proteins. Evaluation of the performance of the various computational tools conducted using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and a resoundingly high average accuracy of 93.6% were obtained. Our comprehensive analysis will help to gain greater understanding for the development of many novel potential therapeutic interventions to defeat Shigella infection.',\n",

The approach is based on two components: undirected graph and Mosaab-metric space. The significant application of this approach is to visualize the segmented genome of a virus. We use Influenza and Ebola viruses as examples to demonstrate the robustness of this approach and to conduct comparisons. This approach can provide researchers with deep insights about information structures extracted from a segmented genome as a composite biodata point, and consequently, to capture the segmented genetic variations and diversity (variants) in composite data points.',\n",
              " 'Comparison of the Genetic Alterations between Primary Colorectal Cancers and Their Corresponding Patient-Derived Xenograft Tissues\\n\\nPatient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are useful tools for tumor biology research and testing the efficacy of candidate anticancer drugs targeting the druggable mutations identified in tumor tissue. However, it is still unknown how much of the genetic alterations identified in primary tumors are consistently detected in tumor tissues in the PDX model. In this study, we analyzed the genetic alterations of three primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) and matched xenograft tissues in PDX models using a next-generation sequencing cancer panel. Of the 17 somatic mutations identified from the three CRCs, 14 (82.4%) were consistently identified in both primary and xenograft tumors. The other three mutations identified in the primary tumor were not detected in the xenograft tumor tissue. There was no newly identified mutation in the xenograft tumor tissues. In addition to the somatic mutations, the copy number alteration profiles were also largely consistent between the primary tumor and xenograft tissue. All of these data suggest that the PDX tumor model preserves the majority of the key mutations detected in the primary tumor site. This study provides evidence that the PDX model is useful for testing targeted therapies in the clinical field and research on precision medicine.',\n",
              " 'Identification of ERBB Pathway-Activated Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer\\n\\nIntratumor heterogeneity within a single tumor mass is one of the hallmarks of malignancy and has been reported in various tumor types. The molecular characterization of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a public resource, an ERBB pathway activated triple-negative cell population was identified. The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.',\n",

In this article, the current status of the Japanese version of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) is reviewed. Online investigation found that Japanese-English dictionaries, which assign MeSH information to applicable terms, but use them for NLP, were found to be difficult to access, due to license restrictions. Here, we investigate an open-source Japanese-English glossary as an alternative method for assigning MeSH IDs to Japanese terms, to obtain preliminary data for NLP proof-of-concept.',\n",

Recently, MGI Tech launched a series of new sequencers, including the MGISEQ-2000, which promise to deliver high-quality sequencing data faster and at lower prices than Illumina’s sequencers. In this study, we compared the performance of two major sequencers (MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000) to test whether the MGISEQ-2000 sequencer delivers high-quality sequence data as suggested. We performed RNA sequencing of four human colon cancer samples with the two platforms, and compared the sequencing quality and expression values. The data produced from the MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000 showed high concordance, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. Various quality control (QC) analyses showed that the MGISEQ-2000 data fulfilled the required QC measures. Our study suggests that the performance of the MGISEQ-2000 is comparable to that of the HiSeq 4000 and that the MGISEQ-2000 can be a useful platform for sequencing.',\n",
              " 'Review of statistical methods for survival analysis using genomic data\\n\\nSurvival analysis mainly deals with the time to event, including death, onset of disease, and bankruptcy. The common characteristic of survival analysis is that it contains “censored” data, in which the time to event cannot be completely observed, but instead represents the lower bound of the time to event. Only the occurrence of either time to event or censoring time is observed. Many traditional statistical methods have been effectively used for analyzing survival data with censored observations. However, with the development of high-throughput technologies for producing “omics” data, more advanced statistical methods, such as regularization, should be required to construct the predictive survival model with high-dimensional genomic data. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have been adapted for survival analysis, to fit nonlinear and complex interaction effects between predictors, and achieve more accurate prediction of individual survival probability. Presently, since most clinicians and medical researchers can easily assess statistical programs for analyzing survival data, a review article is helpful for understanding statistical methods used in survival analysis. We review traditional survival methods and regularization methods, with various penalty functions, for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics, and describe machine learning techniques that have been adapted to survival analysis.',\n",
              " 'Antibacterial and Pharmacological Evaluation of Fluoroquinolones: A Chemoinformatics Approach\\n\\nFluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics are an important class of synthetic antibacterial agents. These are the most extensively used drugs for treating bacterial infections in the field of both human and veterinary medicine. Herein, the antibacterial and pharmacological properties of four fluoroquinolones: lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin have been studied. The objective of this study was to analyze the antibacterial characteristics of the different fluoroquinolones. Also, the pharmacological properties of the compounds including the Lipinski rule of five, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, LD50, drug likeliness, and toxicity were evaluated. We found that among all four FQ molecules, ofloxacin showed the highest antibacterial activity through in silico assays with a strong interaction (−38.52 kJ/mol) with the antibacterial target protein (topoisomerase-II DNA gyrase enzyme). The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic analysis also showed that the compounds ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and norfloxacin have good pharmacological properties. Notably, ofloxacin was found to possess an IGC50 (concentration needed to inhibit 50% growth) value of 0.286 μg/L against the Tetrahymena pyriformis protozoa. It also tested negative for the Ames toxicity test, showing its non-carcinogenic character.',\n",
              " 'Mutation Analysis of Synthetic DNA Barcodes in a Fission Yeast Gene Deletion Library by Sanger Sequencing\\n\\nIncorporation of unique barcodes into fission yeast gene deletion collections has enabled the identification of gene functions by growth fitness analysis. For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.',\n",
              " 'Utility of Integrated Analysis of Pharmacogenomics and Pharmacometabolomics in Early Phase Clinical Trial: A Case Study of a New Molecular Entity\\n\\nIn this report, we present a case study of how pharmacogenomics and pharmacometabolomics can be useful to characterize safety and pharmacokinetic profiles in early phase new drug development clinical trials. During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.',\n",
              " 'Genome-Wide Association Studies Associated with Backfat Thickness in Landrace and Yorkshire Pigs\\n\\nAlthough pork quality traits are important commercially, genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have not well considered Landrace and Yorkshire pigs worldwide. Landrace and Yorkshire pigs are important pork-providing breeds. Although quantitative trait loci of pigs are well-developed, significant genes in GWASs of pigs in Korea must be studied. Through a GWAS using the PLINK program, study of the significant genes in Korean pigs was performed. We conducted a GWAS and surveyed the gene ontology (GO) terms associated with the backfat thickness (BF) trait of these pigs. We included the breed information (Yorkshire and Landrace pigs) as a covariate. The significant genes after false discovery rate (<0.01) correction were AFG1L, SCAI, RIMS1, and SPDEF. The major GO terms for the top 5% of genes were related to neuronal genes, cell morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization. The neuronal genes were previously reported as being associated with backfat thickness. However, the genes in our results were novel, and they included ZNF280D, BAIAP2, LRTM2, GABRA5, PCDH15, HERC1, DTNBP1, SLIT2, TRAPPC9, NGFR, APBB2, RBPJ, and ABL2. These novel genes might have roles in important cellular and physiological functions related to BF accumulation. The genes related to cell morphogenesis were NOX4, MKLN1, ZNF280D, BAIAP2, DNAAF1, LRTM2, PCDH15, NGFR, RBPJ, MYH9, APBB2, DTNBP1, TRIM62, and SLIT2. The genes that belonged to actin cytoskeleton organization were MKLN1, BAIAP2, PCDH15, BCAS3, MYH9, DTNBP1, ABL2, ADD2, and SLIT2.',\n",

Although the history of miRNA investigation in autoimmune Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS) is fairly short, a substantial amount of data has already been accumulated. These findings clearly indicate potential clinical implications of miRNAs, such as autoantigen expression and autoantibody production, viral miRNAs regulating the calcium signaling pathway, and aberrant immune cell regulation and cytokine production. Research endeavors in the field are currently underway to select disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by utilizing different types of tissues or biological specimens of SjS patients. Various techniques for miRNA analysis with different stringencies have been applied, with the most recent one being next-generation sequencing. This review compiles and highlights differentially-expressed miRNAs in various samples collected from SjS patients and their potential implications in the pathogenesis of SjS. To facilitate the development of miRNA-targeted personalized therapy in the future, we urge more follow-up studies that confirm these findings and elucidate the immunopathological roles of differentially-expressed miRNAs. Furthermore, improved diagnostic criteria for the disease itself will minimize sampling errors in patient recruitment, preventing the generation of inconsistent data.',\n",
              " 'Identification of Viral Taxon-Specific Genes (VTSG): Application to Caliciviridae\\n\\nVirus taxonomy was initially determined by clinical experiments based on phenotype. However, with the development of sequence analysis methods, genotype-based classification was also applied. With the development of genome sequence analysis technology, there is an increasing demand for virus taxonomy to be extended from in vivo and in vitro to in silico. In this study, we verified the consistency of the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses taxonomy using an in silico approach, aiming to identify the specific sequence for each virus. We applied this approach to norovirus in Caliciviridae, which causes 90% of gastroenteritis cases worldwide. First, based on the dogma “protein structure determines its function,” we hypothesized that the specific sequence can be identified by the specific structure. Firstly, we extracted the coding region (CDS). Secondly, the CDS protein sequences of each genus were annotated by the conserved domain database (CDD) search. Finally, the conserved domains of each genus in Caliciviridae are classified by RPS-BLAST with CDD. The analysis result is that Caliciviridae has sequences including RNA helicase in common. In case of Norovirus, Calicivirus coat protein C terminal and viral polyprotein N-terminal appears as a specific domain in Caliciviridae. It does not include in the other genera in Caliciviridae. If this method is utilized to detect specific conserved domains, it can be used as classification keywords based on protein functional structure. After determining the specific protein domains, the specific protein domain sequences would be converted to gene sequences. This sequences would be re-used one of viral bio-marks.',\n",
              " 'A Universal Analysis Pipeline for Hybrid Capture-Based Targeted Sequencing Data with Unique Molecular Indexes\\n\\nHybrid capture-based targeted sequencing is being used increasingly for genomic variant profiling in tumor patients. Unique molecular index (UMI) technology has recently been developed and helps to increase the accuracy of variant calling by minimizing polymerase chain reaction biases and sequencing errors. However, UMI-adopted targeted sequencing data analysis is slightly different from the methods for other types of omics data, and its pipeline for variant calling is still being optimized in various study groups for their own purposes. Due to this provincial usage of tools, our group built an analysis pipeline for global application to many studies of targeted sequencing generated with different methods. First, we generated hybrid capture-based data using genomic DNA extracted from tumor tissues of colorectal cancer patients. Sequencing libraries were prepared and pooled together, and an 8-plexed capture library was processed to the enrichment step before 150-bp paired-end sequencing with Illumina HiSeq series. For the analysis, we evaluated several published tools. We focused mainly on the compatibility of the input and output of each tool. Finally, our laboratory built an analysis pipeline specialized for UMI-adopted data. Through this pipeline, we were able to estimate even on-target rates and filtered consensus reads for more accurate variant calling. These results suggest the potential of our analysis pipeline in the precise examination of the quality and efficiency of conducted experiments.',\n",

Many previous studies have already proposed software to analyze GGI, but most methods focus on a binary phenotype in a case-control design. In this study, we developed “Hierarchical structural CoMponent analysis of Gene-Gene Interactions” (HisCoM-GGI) software for GGI analysis with a continuous phenotype. The HisCoM-GGI method considers hierarchical structural relationships between genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), enabling both gene-level and SNP-level interaction analysis in a single model. Furthermore, this software accepts various types of genomic data and supports data management and multithreading to improve the efficiency of genome-wide association study data analysis. We expect that HisCoM-GGI software will provide advanced accessibility to researchers in genetic interaction studies and a more effective way to understand biological mechanisms of complex diseases.',\n",

In this study, high-quality de novo assemblies of blood transcriptomes from these penguins were generated using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 22.2 and 21.8 raw reads were obtained from chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively. These reads were assembled using the Oases assembly platform and resulted in 26,036 and 21,854 contigs with N50 values of 929 and 933 base pairs, respectively. Functional gene annotations through pathway analyses of the Gene Ontology, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were performed for each blood transcriptome, resulting in a similar compositional order between the two transcriptomes. Ortholog comparisons with previously published transcriptomes from the Adélie (P. adeliae) and emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins revealed that a high proportion of the four penguins’ transcriptomes had significant sequence homology. Because blood and tissues of penguins have been used to monitor pollution in Antarctica, immune parameters in blood could be important indicators for understanding the health status of penguins and other Antarctic animals. In the blood transcriptomes, KEGG analyses detected many essential genes involved in the major innate immunity pathways, which are key metabolic pathways for maintaining homeostasis against exogenous infections or toxins. Blood transcriptome studies such as this may be useful for checking the immune and health status of penguins without sacrifice.',\n",

However, they play an important role in many cellular processes including trans-differentiation into type I cells as well as repair of lung injury in response to toxic chemicals and respiratory pathogens. Transcription factors are the regulatory proteins dynamically modulating DNA structure and gene expression. Transcription factor profiling in microarray datasets revealed that several members of AP1, ATF, NF-kB, and C/EBP families involved in diverse responses were expressed in mouse lung type II cells. A transcriptional factor signature consisting of Cebpa, Srebf1, Stat3, Klf5, and Elf3 was identified in lung type II cells, Sox9+ pluripotent lung stem cells as well as in mouse lung development. Identification of the transcription factor profile in mouse lung type II cells will serve as a useful resource and facilitate the integrated analysis of signal transduction pathways and specific gene targets in a variety of physiological conditions.',\n",
              " 'Advances in Serological Diagnosis of Taenia solium Neurocysticercosis in Korea\\n\\nCysticercosis, a parasitic disease caused by Taenia solium metacestode (TsM), has a major global public health impact in terms of disability-adjusted life years. The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms. This article briefly overviews diagnostic approaches and discusses current issues relating to NC serodiagnosis.',\n",

Several studies have demonstrated that lncRNAs are directly or indirectly involved in a variety of biological processes and in the regulation of gene expression. In addition, lncRNAs have important roles in many diseases including cancer. It has been shown that abnormal expression of lncRNAs is observed in several human solid tumors. Several studies have shown that many lncRNAs can function as oncogenes in cancer development through the induction of cell cycle progression, cell proliferation and invasion, anti-apoptosis, and metastasis. Oncogenic lncRNAs have the potential to become promising biomarkers and might be potent prognostic targets in cancer therapy. However, the biological and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA involvement in tumorigenesis have not yet been fully elucidated.

The heritability of an athlete status was reported to be about 70% in a twin study, and at least 155 genetic markers are known to be related with athlete status. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential proteins for oxidative phosphorylation, which is related to aerobic capacity. Thus, mtDNA is a candidate marker for determining physical performance. Recent studies have suggested that polymorphisms of mtDNA are associated with athlete status and/or physical performance in various populations. Therefore, we analyzed mtDNA haplogroups to assess their association with the physical performance of Korean population. The 20 mtDNA haplogroups were determined using the SNaPshot assay. Our result showed a significant association of the haplogroup F with athlete status (odds ratio, 3.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.094 to 8.464; p = 0.012). Athletes with haplogroup F (60.64 ± 3.04) also demonstrated a higher Sargent jump than athletes with other haplogroups (54.28 ± 1.23) (p = 0.041). Thus, our data imply that haplogroup F may play a crucial role in the physical performance of Korean athletes. Functional studies with larger sample sizes are necessary to further substantiate these findings.',\n",

Information on known mRNA targets provided by TargetScan is used to perform HisCoM-mimi. However, multiple databases can be used to find miRNA-mRNA signatures with known biological information through different algorithms. To take these additional databases into account, we present our advanced application software for HisCoM-mimi for binary phenotypes. The proposed HisCoM-mimi supports both TargetScan and miRTarBase, which provides manually-verified information initially gathered by text-mining the literature. By integrating information from miRTarBase into HisCoM-mimi, a broad range of target information derived from the research literature can be analyzed. Another improvement of the new HisCoM-mimi approach is the inclusion of updated algorithms to provide the lasso and elastic-net penalties for users who want to fit a model with a smaller number of selected miRNAs and mRNAs. We expect that our HisCoM-mimi software will make advanced methods accessible to researchers who want to identify miRNA-mRNA interaction pairs related with binary phenotypes.',\n",

RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data have been the most useful source for identification of fusion transcripts. Although a number of algorithms have been developed thus far, most programs produce too many false-positives, thus making experimental confirmation almost impossible. We still lack a reliable program that achieves high precision with reasonable recall rate. Here, we present FusionScan, a highly optimized tool for predicting fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data. We specifically search for split reads composed of intact exons at the fusion boundaries. Using 269 known fusion cases as the reference, we have implemented various mapping and filtering strategies to remove false-positives without discarding genuine fusions. In the performance test using three cell line datasets with validated fusion cases (NCI-H660, K562, and MCF-7), FusionScan outperformed other existing programs by a considerable margin, achieving the precision and recall rates of 60% and 79%, respectively. Simulation test also demonstrated that FusionScan recovered most of true positives without producing an overwhelming number of false-positives regardless of sequencing depth and read length. The computation time was comparable to other leading tools. We also provide several curative means to help users investigate the details of fusion candidates easily. We believe that FusionScan would be a reliable, efficient and convenient program for detecting fusion transcripts that meet the requirements in the clinical and experimental community.

              " 'Identification of neoantigens derived from alternative splicing and RNA modification\\n\\nThe acquisition of somatic mutations is the most common event in cancer. Neoantigens expressed from genes with mutations acquired during carcinogenesis can be tumor-specific. Since the immune system recognizes tumor-specific peptides, they are potential targets for personalized neoantigen-based immunotherapy. However, the discovery of druggable neoantigens remains challenging, suggesting that a deeper understanding of the mechanism of neoantigen generation and better strategies to identify them will be required to realize the promise of neoantigen-based immunotherapy. Alternative splicing and RNA editing events are emerging mechanisms leading to neoantigen production. In this review, we outline recent work involving the large-scale screening of neoantigens produced by alternative splicing and RNA editing. We also describe strategies to predict and validate neoantigens from RNA sequencing data.',\n",

In this paper, data points are heterogeneous sets of biosequences (composite data points). A composite data point is a set of ordinary data points (e.g., set of feature vectors). We theoretically extend the derivation of the largest generalized eigenvalue-based distance metric Dij (γ1) in any linear and non-linear feature spaces. We prove that Dij (γ1) is a metric under any linear and non-linear feature transformation function. We show the sufficiency and efficiency of using the decision rule δΞi (i.e., mean of Dij (γ1)) in classification of heterogeneous sets of biosequences compared with the decision rules minΞi and medianΞi. We analyze the impact of linear and non-linear transformation functions on classifying/clustering collections of heterogeneous sets of biosequences. The impact of the length of a sequence in a heterogeneous sequence-set generated by simulation on the classification and clustering results in linear and non-linear feature spaces is empirically shown in this paper. We propose a new concept: the limiting dispersion map of the existing clusters in heterogeneous sets of biosequences embedded in linear and nonlinear feature spaces, which is based on the limiting distribution of nucleotide compositions estimated from real data sets. Finally, the empirical conclusions and the scientific evidences are deduced from the experiments to support the theoretical side stated in this paper.',\n",

The application of single-cell sequencing, in concert with existing genomics methods, has enabled high-resolution interrogation of the genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and proteome. Applied to cancers, these single-cell multi-omics methods bypass previous limitations on data resolution and have enabled a more nuanced understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of tumor progression, immune evasion, metastasis, and treatment resistance.

Because metabolic intermediates are key factors of DNA methylation and demethylation, perturbations in metabolic homeostasis can trigger alterations in cell-specific patterns of DNA methylation and contribute to disease development, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). During the past decade, genome-wide DNA methylation studies of T2D have expanded our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying T2D. This review summarizes case-control studies of the DNA methylome of T2D and discusses DNA methylation as both a cause and consequence of T2D. Therefore, DNA methylation has potential as a promising T2D biomarker that can be applied to the development of therapeutic strategies for T2D.',\n",

The need to improve the reuse of observations and experimental data has led to the creation of reference ontologies to standardize descriptions of phenotypes and to facilitate their comparison. The scientific literature is largely under-exploited, although extremely rich in phenotype descriptions associated with cultivars and genetic information. In this paper we propose the Wheat Trait Ontology (WTO) that is suitable for the extraction and management of scientific information from scientific papers, and its combination with data from genomic and experimental databases. We describe the principles of WTO construction and show examples of WTO use for the extraction and management of phenotype descriptions obtained from scientific documents.',\n",

While structured databases are supposed to supply readily machine-readable data, unstructured contents, particularly scientific literature, are recognized as a biggest source of data with comprehensive details, e.g., experimental environments and actual observations.\\nSince the importance of scientific literature for data science has been widely recognized, several groups have invested to develop various text mining resources. While many of them are publicly available, interoperability of them remains a critical issue, hindering efficient use or reuse of them, particularly in mix with others.\\nThe Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH) series is annually organized to join forces of biomedical text mining for the goal to promote interoperability among text mining resources. The sixth edition of it was held in Tokyo, February 4-7, 2020, with 52 participants from 9 countries. The first day was held as a symposium to exchange and publicise the activities and ideas of the participants, and the following three days was held as a hackathon: the participants worked on implementing their ideas with collaboration with other participants.\\nWhile the main theme of the event was improving interoperability of biomedical literature mining, which include annotation datasets, tools, platforms, terminology resources, and so on, this year, “social media mining” was also explored as a special theme. Social media is recognized as a good source of raw signals on how people are thinking about what is going on in the world, which are largely missing in scientific literature. Therefore, social media mining is expected to complement literature mining.\\nThis special issue is a collection of the reports on achievements from the hackathon, which address various issues of biomedical literature and social media mining, including document collection, automatic annotation, manual annotation, annotation platform, translation, terminology, ontology, and so on. Note that, except a few, many of the works began just before or even during the hackathon, and due to the limited time for work, they are often small-sized works, which are expected to benefit from collaboration with other participants. Readers will find that many of the articles have co-authorship with, or acknowledgment of other participants, which is a typical nature of hackathon-oriented publications.\\nWe hope that this will be an opportunity for the readers of the journal Genomics & Informatics to get aware of the state-of-the-art activities regarding interoperability of biomedical text mining, and at the same time to observe activities of hackathons like BLAH.',\n",
              " 'Evaluation and Interpretation of Transcriptome Data Underlying Heterogeneous Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\\n\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of progressive lung disease, featured by airflow obstruction. Recently, a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome in lung tissue of COPD patients was performed, but the heterogeneity of the sample was not seriously considered in characterizing the mechanistic dysregulation of COPD. Here, we established a new transcriptome analysis pipeline using a deconvolution process to reduce the heterogeneity and clearly identified that these transcriptome data originated from the mild or moderate stage of COPD patients. Differentially expressed or co-expressed genes in the protein interaction subnetworks were linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune response, as expected. Computational protein localization prediction revealed that 19 proteins showing changes in subcellular localization were mostly related to mitochondria, suggesting that mislocalization of mitochondria-targeting proteins plays an important role in COPD pathology. Our extensive evaluation of COPD transcriptome data could provide guidelines for analyzing heterogeneous gene expression profiles and classifying potential candidate genes that are responsible for the pathogenesis of COPD.',\n",

The extra B chromosomes do not affect the host-plant morphology; therefore, whole transcriptome analysis was performed in 0B and 1B plants to identify differentially expressed genes. A total of 154,810 transcripts were obtained from over 10 Gbp data by de novo assembly. By mapping the raw reads to the de novo transcripts, we identified 7,852 differentially expressed genes (log2FC > |10|), in which 4,059 and 3,794 were up-and down-regulated, respectively, in 1B plants compared to 0B plants. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that various differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular processes including the cell cycle, chromosome breakage and repair, and microtubule formation; all of which may be related to the occurrence and maintenance of B chromosomes. Our data provide insight into transcriptomic changes and evolution of plant B chromosomes and deliver an informative database for future study of B chromosome transcriptomes in the Korean lily.',\n",

Simultaneously, the lack of patient information seriously hinders the diagnosis and treatment of rare/intractable diseases. However, these patient communities are especially active on social media. Data from social media could serve as a source of patient-centric knowledge for these diseases complementary to the information collected in clinical settings and patient registries, and may also have potential for research use. To explore this question, we attempted to extract patient-centric knowledge from social media as a task for the 3-day Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6). We selected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis as use cases of rare and intractable diseases, respectively, and we extracted patient histories related to these health conditions from Twitter. Four diagnosed patients for each disease were selected. From the user timelines of these eight patients, we extracted tweets that might be related to health conditions. Based on our experiment, we show that our approach has considerable potential, although we identified problems that should be addressed in future attempts to mine information about rare/intractable diseases from Twitter.',\n",

In PubMed alone, there have been nearly 2,500 publication entries since 2014 that deal with analyzing social media data from Twitter and Reddit. However, the vast majority of those works do not share their code or data for replicating their studies. With minimal exceptions, the few that do, place the burden on the researcher to figure out how to fetch the data, how to best format their data, and how to create automatic and manual annotations on the acquired data. In order to address this pressing issue, we introduce the Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT), a suite of tools aimed to encapsulate the cumbersome details of acquiring, preprocessing, annotating and standardizing social media data. The purpose of our toolkit is for researchers to focus on answering research questions, and not the technical aspects of using social media data. By using a standard toolkit, researchers will be able to acquire, use, and release data in a consistent way that is transparent for everybody using the toolkit, hence, simplifying research reproducibility and accessibility in the social media domain.',\n",
              " 'Genome-Based Virus Taxonomy with the ICTV Database Extension\\n\\nIn 1966, the International Classification of Viruses (ICNV) was established to standardize the naming of viruses. In 1975, the organization was renamed “International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),” by which it is still known today. The primary virus classification provided by ICTV in 1971 was for viruses infecting vertebrates, which includes 19 genera, 2 families, and 24 unclassified groups. Presently, the 10th virus taxonomy has been published. However, the early classification of viruses was based on clinical results “in vivo” and “in vitro,” as well as on the shape of the Phenotype virus. Due to the development of next-generation sequencing and the accompanying bioinformatics analysis pipelines, a reconstruction of the classification system has been proposed. At a meeting held in Boston, USA between June 9-11, 2016, there was even an in-depth discussion regarding the classification of viruses using metagenomic data. One suggested activity that arose from the meeting was that viral taxonomy should be reconstructed, based on genotype and bioinformatics analysis “in silico.” This article describes our efforts to achieve this goal by construction of a web-based system and the extension of an associated database, based on ICTV taxonomy. This virus taxonomy web system was designed specifically to extend the virus taxonomy up to strain and isolation, which was then connected with the NCBI database to facilitate searches for specific viral genes; there are also links to journals provided by the EMBL RESTful API that improves accessibility for academic groups.',\n",

During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.',\n",

Recent studies have revealed that aberrantly regulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as one of the main classes of cellular transcript plays a key regulatory role in transcriptional and epigenetic pathways. Recent reports have demonstrated that circulating lncRNAs in the blood can be potential biomarkers for CAD. HOTAIR is one of the most cited lncRNAs with a critical role in the initiation and progression of the gene expression regulation. Recent research on the role of the HOTAIR in cardiovascular disease lays the basis for the development of new studies considering this lncRNA as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAD. In this study, we aimed to compare the expression of HOTAIR lncRNA in the blood samples of patients with CAD and control samples. The expression level was examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. Our data shows that expression of HOTAIR is up-regulated in blood samples of patients with CAD.',\n",

Gene expression datasets have recently been considered as a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and subtype classification. However, no attempts have yet been made to apply deep learning using gene expression to neuroblastoma classification, although deep learning has been applied to cancer diagnosis using image data. Taking the International Neuroblastoma Staging System stages as multiple classes, we designed a deep neural network using the gene expression patterns and stages of neuroblastoma patients. Despite a small patient population (n = 280), stage 1 and 4 patients were well distinguished. If it is possible to replicate this approach in a larger population, deep learning could play an important role in neuroblastoma staging.',\n",

For clinicians who are not fluent in English, the HPO has been translated into many languages, and there have been four initiatives to develop Japanese translations. At the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6), a rule-based approach was attempted to determine the preferable Japanese translation for each HPO term among the candidates developed by the four approaches. The relationship between the HPO and Mammalian Phenotype translations was also investigated, with the eventual goal of harmonizing the two translations to facilitate phenotype-based comparisons of species in Japanese through cross-species phenotype matching. In order to deal with the increase in the number of HPO terms and the need for manual curation, it would be useful to have a dictionary containing word-by-word correspondences and fixed translation phrases for English word order. These considerations seem applicable to HPO localization into other languages.',\n",

For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.',\n",

The molecular characterization of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a public resource, an ERBB pathway activated triple-negative cell population was identified. The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.',\n",

Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity “type 1 diabetes” in the phrase “type 1 and type 2 diabetes.” This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE’s existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems.',\n",

The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms. This article briefly overviews diagnostic approaches and discusses current issues relating to NC serodiagnosis.',\n",

The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative combines over 100 controlled vocabularies into its own. However, the OHDSI vocabulary is limited in the sense that it combines multiple terminologies and does not provide a direct way to link them outside of their own self-contained scope. This issue makes the tasks of enriching feature sets by using external resources extremely difficult. In order to address these shortcomings, we have created a linked data version of the OHDSI vocabulary, connecting it with already established linked resources like bioportal, bio2rdf, etc. with the ultimate purpose of enabling the interoperability of resources previously foreign to the OHDSI universe.',\n",

Furthermore, datasets created using distant supervision techniques also have some false negative relations that constitute undocumented/unknown relations (missing from a knowledge base). We propose to improve the distinction between these concepts, by revising a subset of the relations marked as false on the phenotype-gene relations corpus and give the first steps to automatically distinguish between the false (F), negative (N), and unknown (U) results. Our work resulted in a sample of 127 manually annotated FNU relations and a weighted-F1 of 0.5609 for their automatic distinction.

Many methods have been proposed to identify gene-gene interactions. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a well-known method for the detection of gene-gene interactions by reduction from genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism combinations to a binary variable with a value of high risk or low risk. This method has been widely expanded to own a specific objective. Among those expansions, fuzzy-MDR uses the fuzzy set theory for the membership of high risk or low risk and increases the detection rates of gene-gene interactions. Fuzzy-MDR is expanded by a maximum likelihood estimator as a new membership function in empirical fuzzy MDR (EFMDR). However, EFMDR is relatively slow, because it is implemented by R script language. Therefore, in this study, we implemented EFMDR using RCPP (c++ package) for faster executions. Our implementation for faster EFMDR, called EMMDR-Fast, is about 800 times faster than EFMDR written by R script only.',\n",

The OR is a G protein‒coupled receptor that binds the guanine nucleotide-binding Gαolf subunit and the Gβγ dimer to recognize a wide spectrum of organic compounds in accordance with its cognate ligand. Mammalian ORs were originally identified from the olfactory epithelium of rat. However, it has been recently reported that the expression of ORs is not limited to the olfactory organ. In recent decades, they have been found to be expressed in diverse organs or tissues and even tumors in mammals. In this review, the expression and expected function of olfactory receptors that exist throughout an organism’s system are discussed.',\n",
              " 'Identification of LEF1 as a Susceptibility Locus for Kawasaki Disease in Patients Younger than 6 Months of Age\\n\\nKawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile vasculitis predominately affecting infants and children. The dominant incidence age of KD is from 6 months to 5 years of age, and the incidence is unusual in those younger than 6 months and older than 5 years of age. We tried to identify genetic variants specifically associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months or older than 5 years of age. We performed an age-stratified genome-wide association study using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 cases vs. 1,000 controls) and a replication study (1,360 cases vs. 3,553 controls) in the Korean population. Among 26 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in replication study, only a rare nonsynonymous SNP (rs4365796: c.1106C＞T, p.Thr369Met) in the lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) gene was very significantly associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months of age (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; pcombined = 1.10 × 10-5), whereas no association of the same SNP was observed in any other age group of KD patients. The same SNP (rs4365796) in the LEF1 gene showed the same direction of risk effect in Japanese KD patients younger than 6 months of age, although the effect was not statistically significant (OR, 1.42; p = 0.397). This result indicates that the LEF1 gene may play an important role as a susceptibility gene specifically affecting KD patients younger than 6 months of age.',\n",

I first chose [k-means](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering). K-means initializes with a pre-determined number of clusters (I chose 5). Each observation is assigned to a cluster (cluster assignment) so as to minimize the within cluster sum of squares. Next, the mean of the clustered observations is calculated and used as the new cluster centroid. Then, observations are reassigned to clusters and  centroids recalculated in an iterative process until the algorithm reaches convergence.\n",

The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has boosted microbiome research through the study of microbial genomes and allowing a more precise quantification of microbiome abundances and function. Microbiome data analysis is challenging because it involves high-dimensional structured multivariate sparse data and because of its compositional nature. In this review we outline some of the procedures that are most commonly used for microbiome analysis and that are implemented in R packages. We place particular emphasis on the compositional structure of microbiome data. We describe the principles of compositional data analysis and distinguish between standard methods and those that fit into compositional data analysis.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Text corpus for this journal annotated with various levels of linguistic information would be a valuable resource as the process of information extraction requires syntactic, semantic, and higher levels of natural language processing. In this study, we publish our new corpus called GNI Corpus version 1.0, extracted and annotated from full texts of Genomics & Informatics, with NLTK (Natural Language ToolKit)-based text mining script. The preliminary version of the corpus could be used as a training and testing set of a system that serves a variety of functions for future biomedical text mining.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'An Advanced Understanding of Uterine Microbial Ecology Associated with Metritis in Dairy Cows\\n\\nMetritis, the inflammation of the uterus caused by polymicrobial infections, is a prevalent and costly disease to the dairy industry as it decreases milk yield, survival, and the welfare of dairy cows. Although affected cows are treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics such as ceftiofur, endometrial and ovarian function are not fully recovered, which results in subfertility and infertility. According to culture-dependent studies, uterine pathogens include Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Prevotella melaninogenica. Recent studies using high-throughput sequencing observed very low relative abundance of Escherichia coli, Trueperella pyogenes, and Prevotella melaninogenica in cows with metritis. Herein, we propose that metritis is associated with a dysbiosis of the uterine microbiota, which is characterized by high abundance\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Genetic Hearing Loss and Gene Therapy\\n\\nGenetic hearing loss crosses almost all the categories of hearing loss which includes the following: conductive, sensory, and neural; syndromic and nonsyndromic; congenital, progressive, and adult onset; high-frequency, low-frequency, or mixed frequency; mild or profound; and recessive, dominant, or sex-linked. Genes play a role in almost half of all cases of hearing loss but effective treatment options are very limited. Genetic hearing loss is considered to be extremely genetically heterogeneous. The advancements in genomics have been instrumental to the identification of more than 6,000 causative variants in more than 150 genes causing hearing loss. Identification of genes for hearing impairment provides an increased insight into the normal development and function of cells in the auditory system. These defective genes will ultimately be important therapeutic targets. However, the auditory system is extremely complex which requires tremendous advances in gene therapy including gene vectors, routes of administration, and therapeutic approaches. This review summarizes and discusses recent advances in elucidating the genomics of genetic hearing loss and technologies aimed at developing a gene therapy that may become a treatment option for in the near future.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Functional Prediction of Hypothetical Proteins from Shigella flexneri and Validation of the Predicted Models by Using ROC Curve Analysis\\n\\nShigella spp. constitutes some of the key pathogens responsible for the global burden of diarrhoeal disease. With over 164 million reported cases per annum, shigellosis accounts for 1.1 million deaths each year. Majority of these cases occur among the children of the developing nations and the emergence of multi-drug resistance Shigella strains in clinical isolates demands the development of better/new drugs against this pathogen. The genome of Shigella flexneri was extensively analyzed and found 4,362 proteins among which the functions of 674 proteins, termed as hypothetical proteins (HPs) had not been previously elucidated. Amino acid sequences of all these 674 HPs were studied and the functions of a total of 39 HPs have been assigned with high level of confidence. Here we have utilized a combination of the latest versions of databases to assign the precise function of HPs for which no experimental information is available. These HPs were found to belong to various classes of proteins such as enzymes, binding proteins, signal transducers, lipoprotein, transporters, virulence and other proteins. Evaluation of the performance of the various computational tools conducted using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and a resoundingly high average accuracy of 93.6% were obtained. Our comprehensive analysis will help to gain greater understanding for the development of many novel potential therapeutic interventions to defeat Shigella infection.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Insights of window-based mechanism approach to visualize composite bioData point in feature spaces\\n\\nIn this paper, we propose a window-based mechanism visualization approach as an alternative way to measure the seriousness of the difference among data-insights extracted from a composite biodata point. The approach is based on two components: undirected graph and Mosaab-metric space. The significant application of this approach is to visualize the segmented genome of a virus. We use Influenza and Ebola viruses as examples to demonstrate the robustness of this approach and to conduct comparisons. This approach can provide researchers with deep insights about information structures extracted from a segmented genome as a composite biodata point, and consequently, to capture the segmented genetic variations and diversity (variants) in composite data points.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Comparison of the Genetic Alterations between Primary Colorectal Cancers and Their Corresponding Patient-Derived Xenograft Tissues\\n\\nPatient-derived xenograft (PDX) models are useful tools for tumor biology research and testing the efficacy of candidate anticancer drugs targeting the druggable mutations identified in tumor tissue. However, it is still unknown how much of the genetic alterations identified in primary tumors are consistently detected in tumor tissues in the PDX model. In this study, we analyzed the genetic alterations of three primary colorectal cancers (CRCs) and matched xenograft tissues in PDX models using a next-generation sequencing cancer panel. Of the 17 somatic mutations identified from the three CRCs, 14 (82.4%) were consistently identified in both primary and xenograft tumors. The other three mutations identified in the primary tumor were not detected in the xenograft tumor tissue. There was no newly identified mutation in the xenograft tumor tissues. In addition to the somatic mutations, the copy number alteration profiles were also largely consistent between the primary tumor and xenograft tissue. All of these data suggest that the PDX tumor model preserves the majority of the key mutations detected in the primary tumor site. This study provides evidence that the PDX model is useful for testing targeted therapies in the clinical field and research on precision medicine.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Identification of ERBB Pathway-Activated Cells in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer\\n\\nIntratumor heterogeneity within a single tumor mass is one of the hallmarks of malignancy and has been reported in various tumor types. The molecular characterization of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a public resource, an ERBB pathway activated triple-negative cell population was identified. The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Recently, MGI Tech launched a series of new sequencers, including the MGISEQ-2000, which promise to deliver high-quality sequencing data faster and at lower prices than Illumina’s sequencers. In this study, we compared the performance of two major sequencers (MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000) to test whether the MGISEQ-2000 sequencer delivers high-quality sequence data as suggested. We performed RNA sequencing of four human colon cancer samples with the two platforms, and compared the sequencing quality and expression values. The data produced from the MGISEQ-2000 and HiSeq 4000 showed high concordance, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from 0.98 to 0.99. Various quality control (QC) analyses showed that the MGISEQ-2000 data fulfilled the required QC measures.

              " 'Review of statistical methods for survival analysis using genomic data\\n\\nSurvival analysis mainly deals with the time to event, including death, onset of disease, and bankruptcy. The common characteristic of survival analysis is that it contains “censored” data, in which the time to event cannot be completely observed, but instead represents the lower bound of the time to event. Only the occurrence of either time to event or censoring time is observed. Many traditional statistical methods have been effectively used for analyzing survival data with censored observations. However, with the development of high-throughput technologies for producing “omics” data, more advanced statistical methods, such as regularization, should be required to construct the predictive survival model with high-dimensional genomic data. Furthermore, machine learning approaches have been adapted for survival analysis, to fit nonlinear and complex interaction effects between predictors, and achieve more accurate prediction of individual survival probability. Presently, since most clinicians and medical researchers can easily assess statistical programs for analyzing survival data, a review article is helpful for understanding statistical methods used in survival analysis. We review traditional survival methods and regularization methods, with various penalty functions, for the analysis of high-dimensional genomics, and describe machine learning techniques that have been adapted to survival analysis.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

These are the most extensively used drugs for treating bacterial infections in the field of both human and veterinary medicine. Herein, the antibacterial and pharmacological properties of four fluoroquinolones: lomefloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin have been studied. The objective of this study was to analyze the antibacterial characteristics of the different fluoroquinolones. Also, the pharmacological properties of the compounds including the Lipinski rule of five, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion, LD50, drug likeliness, and toxicity were evaluated. We found that among all four FQ molecules, ofloxacin showed the highest antibacterial activity through in silico assays with a strong interaction (−38.52 kJ/mol) with the antibacterial target protein (topoisomerase-II DNA gyrase enzyme). The pharmacological and pharmacokinetic analysis also showed that the compounds ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, lomefloxacin and norfloxacin have good pharmacological properties. Notably, ofloxacin was found to possess an IGC50 (concentration needed to inhibit 50% growth) value of 0.286 μg/L against the Tetrahymena pyriformis protozoa.

For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Landrace and Yorkshire pigs are important pork-providing breeds. Although quantitative trait loci of pigs are well-developed, significant genes in GWASs of pigs in Korea must be studied. Through a GWAS using the PLINK program, study of the significant genes in Korean pigs was performed. We conducted a GWAS and surveyed the gene ontology (GO) terms associated with the backfat thickness (BF) trait of these pigs. We included the breed information (Yorkshire and Landrace pigs) as a covariate. The significant genes after false discovery rate (<0.01) correction were AFG1L, SCAI, RIMS1, and SPDEF. The major GO terms for the top 5% of genes were related to neuronal genes, cell morphogenesis and actin cytoskeleton organization. The neuronal genes were previously reported as being associated with backfat thickness. However, the genes in our results were novel, and they included ZNF280D, BAIAP2, LRTM2, GABRA5, PCDH15, HERC1, DTNBP1, SLIT2, TRAPPC9, NGFR, APBB2, RBPJ, and ABL2. These novel genes might have roles in important cellular and physiological functions related to BF accumulation.

Although the history of miRNA investigation in autoimmune Sjögren’s syndrome (SjS) is fairly short, a substantial amount of data has already been accumulated. These findings clearly indicate potential clinical implications of miRNAs, such as autoantigen expression and autoantibody production, viral miRNAs regulating the calcium signaling pathway, and aberrant immune cell regulation and cytokine production. Research endeavors in the field are currently underway to select disease-specific diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers by utilizing different types of tissues or biological specimens of SjS patients. Various techniques for miRNA analysis with different stringencies have been applied, with the most recent one being next-generation sequencing. This review compiles and highlights differentially-expressed miRNAs in various samples collected from SjS patients and their potential implications in the pathogenesis of SjS. To facilitate the development of miRNA-targeted personalized therapy in the future, we urge more follow-up studies that confirm these findings and elucidate the immunopathological roles of differentially-expressed miRNAs. Furthermore, improved diagnostic criteria for the disease itself will minimize sampling errors in patient recruitment, preventing the generation of inconsistent data.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

However, with the development of sequence analysis methods, genotype-based classification was also applied. With the development of genome sequence analysis technology, there is an increasing demand for virus taxonomy to be extended from in vivo and in vitro to in silico. In this study, we verified the consistency of the current International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses taxonomy using an in silico approach, aiming to identify the specific sequence for each virus. We applied this approach to norovirus in Caliciviridae, which causes 90% of gastroenteritis cases worldwide. First, based on the dogma “protein structure determines its function,” we hypothesized that the specific sequence can be identified by the specific structure. Firstly, we extracted the coding region (CDS). Secondly, the CDS protein sequences of each genus were annotated by the conserved domain database (CDD) search. Finally, the conserved domains of each genus in Caliciviridae are classified by RPS-BLAST with CDD. The analysis result is that Caliciviridae has sequences including RNA helicase in common. In case of Norovirus, Calicivirus coat protein C terminal and viral polyprotein N-terminal appears as a specific domain in Caliciviridae. It does not include in the other genera in Caliciviridae. If this method is utilized to detect specific conserved domains, it can be used as classification keywords based on protein functional structure. After determining the specific protein domains, the specific protein domain sequences would be converted to gene sequences. This sequences would be re-used one of viral bio-marks.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Unique molecular index (UMI) technology has recently been developed and helps to increase the accuracy of variant calling by minimizing polymerase chain reaction biases and sequencing errors. However, UMI-adopted targeted sequencing data analysis is slightly different from the methods for other types of omics data, and its pipeline for variant calling is still being optimized in various study groups for their own purposes. Due to this provincial usage of tools, our group built an analysis pipeline for global application to many studies of targeted sequencing generated with different methods. First, we generated hybrid capture-based data using genomic DNA extracted from tumor tissues of colorectal cancer patients. Sequencing libraries were prepared and pooled together, and an 8-plexed capture library was processed to the enrichment step before 150-bp paired-end sequencing with Illumina HiSeq series. For the analysis, we evaluated several published tools. We focused mainly on the compatibility of the input and output of each tool. Finally, our laboratory built an analysis pipeline specialized for UMI-adopted data. Through this pipeline, we were able to estimate even on-target rates and filtered consensus reads for more accurate variant calling. These results suggest the potential of our analysis pipeline in the precise examination of the quality and efficiency of conducted experiments.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

In this study, high-quality de novo assemblies of blood transcriptomes from these penguins were generated using the Illumina MiSeq platform. A total of 22.2 and 21.8 raw reads were obtained from chinstrap and gentoo penguins, respectively. These reads were assembled using the Oases assembly platform and resulted in 26,036 and 21,854 contigs with N50 values of 929 and 933 base pairs, respectively. Functional gene annotations through pathway analyses of the Gene Ontology, EuKaryotic Orthologous Groups, and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were performed for each blood transcriptome, resulting in a similar compositional order between the two transcriptomes. Ortholog comparisons with previously published transcriptomes from the Adélie (P. adeliae) and emperor (Aptenodytes forsteri) penguins revealed that a high proportion of the four penguins’ transcriptomes had significant sequence homology. Because blood and tissues of penguins have been used to monitor pollution in Antarctica, immune parameters in blood could be important indicators for understanding the health status of penguins and other Antarctic animals. In the blood transcriptomes, KEGG analyses detected many essential genes involved in the major innate immunity pathways, which are key metabolic pathways for maintaining homeostasis against exogenous infections or toxins.

The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms.

The heritability of an athlete status was reported to be about 70% in a twin study, and at least 155 genetic markers are known to be related with athlete status. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes essential proteins for oxidative phosphorylation, which is related to aerobic capacity. Thus, mtDNA is a candidate marker for determining physical performance. Recent studies have suggested that polymorphisms of mtDNA are associated with athlete status and/or physical performance in various populations. Therefore, we analyzed mtDNA haplogroups to assess their association with the physical performance of Korean population. The 20 mtDNA haplogroups were determined using the SNaPshot assay. Our result showed a significant association of the haplogroup F with athlete status (odds ratio, 3.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.094 to 8.464; p = 0.012). Athletes with haplogroup F (60.64 ± 3.04) also demonstrated a higher Sargent jump than athletes with other haplogroups (54.28 ± 1.23) (p = 0.041). Thus, our data imply that haplogroup F may play a crucial role in the physical performance of Korean athletes.

Although a number of algorithms have been developed thus far, most programs produce too many false-positives, thus making experimental confirmation almost impossible. We still lack a reliable program that achieves high precision with reasonable recall rate. Here, we present FusionScan, a highly optimized tool for predicting fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data. We specifically search for split reads composed of intact exons at the fusion boundaries. Using 269 known fusion cases as the reference, we have implemented various mapping and filtering strategies to remove false-positives without discarding genuine fusions. In the performance test using three cell line datasets with validated fusion cases (NCI-H660, K562, and MCF-7), FusionScan outperformed other existing programs by a considerable margin, achieving the precision and recall rates of 60% and 79%, respectively. Simulation test also demonstrated that FusionScan recovered most of true positives without producing an overwhelming number of false-positives regardless of sequencing depth and read length. The computation time was comparable to other leading tools. We also provide several curative means to help users investigate the details of fusion candidates easily.

In this paper, data points are heterogeneous sets of biosequences (composite data points). A composite data point is a set of ordinary data points (e.g., set of feature vectors). We theoretically extend the derivation of the largest generalized eigenvalue-based distance metric Dij (γ1) in any linear and non-linear feature spaces. We prove that Dij (γ1) is a metric under any linear and non-linear feature transformation function. We show the sufficiency and efficiency of using the decision rule δΞi (i.e., mean of Dij (γ1)) in classification of heterogeneous sets of biosequences compared with the decision rules minΞi and medianΞi. We analyze the impact of linear and non-linear transformation functions on classifying/clustering collections of heterogeneous sets of biosequences. The impact of the length of a sequence in a heterogeneous sequence-set generated by simulation on the classification and clustering results in linear and non-linear feature spaces is empirically shown in this paper. We propose a new concept: the limiting dispersion map of the existing clusters in heterogeneous sets of biosequences embedded in linear and nonlinear feature spaces, which is based on the limiting distribution of nucleotide compositions estimated from real data sets.

This review details the growing number of novel single-cell multi-omics methods applied to tumors and further discusses recent discoveries emerging from these approaches, especially in regard to immunotherapy.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'DNA methylation: a cause and consequence of type 2 diabetes\\n\\nDNA methylation is a relatively stable epigenetic modification that can regulate and stabilize gene expression patterns and hence establish cell identity. Because metabolic intermediates are key factors of DNA methylation and demethylation, perturbations in metabolic homeostasis can trigger alterations in cell-specific patterns of DNA methylation and contribute to disease development, including type 2 diabetes (T2D). During the past decade, genome-wide DNA methylation studies of T2D have expanded our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying T2D. This review summarizes case-control studies of the DNA methylome of T2D and discusses DNA methylation as both a cause and consequence of T2D. Therefore, DNA methylation has potential as a promising T2D biomarker that can be applied to the development of therapeutic strategies for T2D.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'WTO, an ontology for wheat traits and phenotypes in scientific publications\\n\\nPhenotyping is a major issue for wheat agriculture to meet the challenges of adaptation of wheat varieties to climate change and chemical input reduction in crop. The need to improve the reuse of observations and experimental data has led to the creation of reference ontologies to standardize descriptions of phenotypes and to facilitate their comparison. The scientific literature is largely under-exploited, although extremely rich in phenotype descriptions associated with cultivars and genetic information. In this paper we propose the Wheat Trait Ontology (WTO) that is suitable for the extraction and management of scientific information from scientific papers, and its combination with data from genomic and experimental databases. We describe the principles of WTO construction and show examples of WTO use for the extraction and management of phenotype descriptions obtained from scientific documents.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Editor’s introduction to the special issue of the 6th Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH6)\\n\\nAs data science gains in importance and popularity, the need for accessing data in scientific literature is rapidly increasing. While structured databases are supposed to supply readily machine-readable data, unstructured contents, particularly scientific literature, are recognized as a biggest source of data with comprehensive details, e.g., experimental environments and actual observations.\\nSince the importance of scientific literature for data science has been widely recognized, several groups have invested to develop various text mining resources. While many of them are publicly available, interoperability of them remains a critical issue, hindering efficient use or reuse of them, particularly in mix with others.\\nThe Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH) series is annually organized to join forces of biomedical text mining for the goal to promote interoperability among text mining resources. The sixth edition of it was held in Tokyo, February 4-7, 2020, with 52 participants from 9 countries. The first day was held as a symposium to exchange and publicise the activities and ideas of the participants, and the following three days was held as a hackathon: the participants worked on implementing their ideas with collaboration with other participants.\\nWhile the main theme of the event was improving interoperability of biomedical literature mining, which include annotation datasets, tools, platforms, terminology resources, and so on, this year, “social media mining” was also explored as a special theme. Social media is recognized as a good source of raw signals on how people are thinking about what is going on in the world, which are largely missing in scientific literature. Therefore, social media mining is expected to complement literature mining.\\nThis special issue is a collection of the reports on achievements from the hackathon, which address various issues of biomedical literature and social media mining, including document collection, automatic annotation, manual annotation, annotation platform, translation, terminology, ontology, and so on. Note that, except a few, many of the works began just before or even during the hackathon, and due to the limited time for work, they are often small-sized works, which are expected to benefit from collaboration with other participants. Readers will find that many of the articles have co-authorship with, or acknowledgment of other participants, which is a typical nature of hackathon-oriented publications.\\nWe hope that this will be an opportunity for the readers of the journal Genomics & Informatics to get aware of the state-of-the-art activities regarding interoperability of biomedical text mining, and at the same time to observe activities of hackathons like BLAH.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Evaluation and Interpretation of Transcriptome Data Underlying Heterogeneous Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease\\n\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a type of progressive lung disease, featured by airflow obstruction. Recently, a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome in lung tissue of COPD patients was performed, but the heterogeneity of the sample was not seriously considered in characterizing the mechanistic dysregulation of COPD. Here, we established a new transcriptome analysis pipeline using a deconvolution process to reduce the heterogeneity and clearly identified that these transcriptome data originated from the mild or moderate stage of COPD patients. Differentially expressed or co-expressed genes in the protein interaction subnetworks were linked with mitochondrial dysfunction and the immune response, as expected. Computational protein localization prediction revealed that 19 proteins showing changes in subcellular localization were mostly related to mitochondria, suggesting that mislocalization of mitochondria-targeting proteins plays an important role in COPD pathology. Our extensive evaluation of COPD transcriptome data could provide guidelines for analyzing heterogeneous gene expression profiles and classifying potential candidate genes that are responsible for the pathogenesis of COPD.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The extra B chromosomes do not affect the host-plant morphology; therefore, whole transcriptome analysis was performed in 0B and 1B plants to identify differentially expressed genes. A total of 154,810 transcripts were obtained from over 10 Gbp data by de novo assembly. By mapping the raw reads to the de novo transcripts, we identified 7,852 differentially expressed genes (log2FC > |10|), in which 4,059 and 3,794 were up-and down-regulated, respectively, in 1B plants compared to 0B plants. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that various differentially expressed genes were involved in cellular processes including the cell cycle, chromosome breakage and repair, and microtubule formation; all of which may be related to the occurrence and maintenance of B chromosomes. Our data provide insight into transcriptomic changes and evolution of plant B chromosomes and deliver an informative database for future study of B chromosome transcriptomes in the Korean lily.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Simultaneously, the lack of patient information seriously hinders the diagnosis and treatment of rare/intractable diseases. However, these patient communities are especially active on social media. Data from social media could serve as a source of patient-centric knowledge for these diseases complementary to the information collected in clinical settings and patient registries, and may also have potential for research use. To explore this question, we attempted to extract patient-centric knowledge from social media as a task for the 3-day Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6). We selected amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis as use cases of rare and intractable diseases, respectively, and we extracted patient histories related to these health conditions from Twitter. Four diagnosed patients for each disease were selected. From the user timelines of these eight patients, we extracted tweets that might be related to health conditions. Based on our experiment, we show that our approach has considerable potential, although we identified problems that should be addressed in future attempts to mine information about rare/intractable diseases from Twitter.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

              " 'Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT)\\n\\nThere has been a dramatic increase in the popularity of utilizing social media data for research purposes within the biomedical community. In PubMed alone, there have been nearly 2,500 publication entries since 2014 that deal with analyzing social media data from Twitter and Reddit. However, the vast majority of those works do not share their code or data for replicating their studies. With minimal exceptions, the few that do, place the burden on the researcher to figure out how to fetch the data, how to best format their data, and how to create automatic and manual annotations on the acquired data. In order to address this pressing issue, we introduce the Social Media Mining Toolkit (SMMT), a suite of tools aimed to encapsulate the cumbersome details of acquiring, preprocessing, annotating and standardizing social media data. The purpose of our toolkit is for researchers to focus on answering research questions, and not the technical aspects of using social media data. By using a standard toolkit, researchers will be able to acquire, use, and release data in a consistent way that is transparent for everybody using the toolkit, hence, simplifying research reproducibility and accessibility in the social media domain.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Genome-Based Virus Taxonomy with the ICTV Database Extension\\n\\nIn 1966, the International Classification of Viruses (ICNV) was established to standardize the naming of viruses. In 1975, the organization was renamed “International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV),” by which it is still known today. The primary virus classification provided by ICTV in 1971 was for viruses infecting vertebrates, which includes 19 genera, 2 families, and 24 unclassified groups. Presently, the 10th virus taxonomy has been published. However, the early classification of viruses was based on clinical results “in vivo” and “in vitro,” as well as on the shape of the Phenotype virus. Due to the development of next-generation sequencing and the accompanying bioinformatics analysis pipelines, a reconstruction of the classification system has been proposed. At a meeting held in Boston, USA between June 9-11, 2016, there was even an in-depth discussion regarding the classification of viruses using metagenomic data. One suggested activity that arose from the meeting was that viral taxonomy should be reconstructed, based on genotype and bioinformatics analysis “in silico.” This article describes our efforts to achieve this goal by construction of a web-based system and the extension of an associated database, based on ICTV taxonomy. This virus taxonomy web system was designed specifically to extend the virus taxonomy up to strain and isolation, which was then connected with the NCBI database to facilitate searches for specific viral genes; there are also links to journals provided by the EMBL RESTful API that improves accessibility for academic groups.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

During conducting a first-in-human trial for a new molecular entity, we were able to determine the mechanism of dichotomized variability in plasma drug concentrations, which appeared closely related to adverse drug reactions (ADRs) through integrated omics analysis. The pharmacogenomics screening was performed from whole blood samples using the Affymetrix DMET (Drug-Metabolizing Enzymes and Transporters) Plus microarray, and confirmation of genetic variants was performed using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Recent studies have revealed that aberrantly regulated long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) as one of the main classes of cellular transcript plays a key regulatory role in transcriptional and epigenetic pathways. Recent reports have demonstrated that circulating lncRNAs in the blood can be potential biomarkers for CAD. HOTAIR is one of the most cited lncRNAs with a critical role in the initiation and progression of the gene expression regulation. Recent research on the role of the HOTAIR in cardiovascular disease lays the basis for the development of new studies considering this lncRNA as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in CAD. In this study, we aimed to compare the expression of HOTAIR lncRNA in the blood samples of patients with CAD and control samples. The expression level was examined by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction technique. Our data shows that expression of HOTAIR is up-regulated in blood samples of patients with CAD.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Gene expression datasets have recently been considered as a powerful tool for cancer diagnosis and subtype classification. However, no attempts have yet been made to apply deep learning using gene expression to neuroblastoma classification, although deep learning has been applied to cancer diagnosis using image data. Taking the International Neuroblastoma Staging System stages as multiple classes, we designed a deep neural network using the gene expression patterns and stages of neuroblastoma patients. Despite a small patient population (n = 280), stage 1 and 4 patients were well distinguished. If it is possible to replicate this approach in a larger population, deep learning could play an important role in neuroblastoma staging.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

For clinicians who are not fluent in English, the HPO has been translated into many languages, and there have been four initiatives to develop Japanese translations. At the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 6 (BLAH6), a rule-based approach was attempted to determine the preferable Japanese translation for each HPO term among the candidates developed by the four approaches. The relationship between the HPO and Mammalian Phenotype translations was also investigated, with the eventual goal of harmonizing the two translations to facilitate phenotype-based comparisons of species in Japanese through cross-species phenotype matching. In order to deal with the increase in the number of HPO terms and the need for manual curation, it would be useful to have a dictionary containing word-by-word correspondences and fixed translation phrases for English word order. These considerations seem applicable to HPO localization into other languages.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Mutation Analysis of Synthetic DNA Barcodes in a Fission Yeast Gene Deletion Library by Sanger Sequencing\\n\\nIncorporation of unique barcodes into fission yeast gene deletion collections has enabled the identification of gene functions by growth fitness analysis. For fine tuning, it is important to examine barcode sequences, because mutations arise during strain construction. Out of 8,708 barcodes (4,354 strains) covering 88.5% of all 4,919 open reading frames, 7,734 barcodes (88.8%) were validated as high-fidelity to be inserted at the correct positions by Sanger sequencing. Sequence examination of the 7,734 high-fidelity barcodes revealed that 1,039 barcodes (13.4%) deviated from the original design. In total, 1,284 mutations (mutation rate of 16.6%) exist within the 1,039 mutated barcodes, which is comparable to budding yeast (18%). When the type of mutation was considered, substitutions accounted for 845 mutations (10.9%), deletions accounted for 319 mutations (4.1%), and insertions accounted for 121 mutations (1.6%). Peculiarly, the frequency of substitutions (67.6%) was unexpectedly higher than in budding yeast (~28%) and well above the predicted error of Sanger sequencing (~2%), which might have arisen during the solid-phase oligonucleotide synthesis and PCR amplification of the barcodes during strain construction. When the mutation rate was analyzed by position within 20-mer barcodes using the 1,284 mutations from the 7,734 sequenced barcodes, there was no significant difference between up-tags and down-tags at a given position. The mutation frequency at a given position was similar at most positions, ranging from 0.4% (32/7,734) to 1.1% (82/7,734), except at position 1, which was highest (3.1%), as in budding yeast. Together, well-defined barcode sequences, combined with the next-generation sequencing platform, promise to make the fission yeast gene deletion library a powerful tool for understanding gene function.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The molecular characterization of intratumor heterogeneity in breast cancer is a significant challenge for effective treatment. Using single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a public resource, an ERBB pathway activated triple-negative cell population was identified. The differential expression of three subtyping marker genes (ERBB2, ESR1, and PGR) was not changed in the bulk RNA-seq data, but the single-cell transcriptomes showed intratumor heterogeneity. This result shows that ERBB signaling is activated using an indirect route and that the molecular subtype is changed on a single-cell level. Our data propose a different view on breast cancer subtypes, clarifying much confusion in this field and contributing to precision medicine.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

We are currently developing a Web application to support finding alternative methods to animal experiments. The current (under development) version of the application utilizes external tools and resources for document processing, and relies on the PubAnnotation ecosystem for annotation querying, annotation storage, dictionary-based tagging of cell lines, and annotation visualization. Currently, our two PubAnnotation repositories for discourse elements contain annotations for more than 110k PubMed documents. Further, we created an annotator for cell lines that contain more than 196k terms from Cellosaurus.

Without good entity recognition, methods will mislabel searched text and will miss important information or identify spurious text that will frustrate users. Most tools do not capture non-contiguous entities which are separate spans of text that together refer to an entity, e.g., the entity “type 1 diabetes” in the phrase “type 1 and type 2 diabetes.” This type is commonly found in biomedical texts, especially in lists, where multiple biomedical entities are named in shortened form to avoid repeating words. Most text annotation systems, that enable users to view and edit entity annotations, do not support non-contiguous entities. Therefore, experts cannot even visualize non-contiguous entities, let alone annotate them to build valuable datasets for machine learning methods. To combat this problem and as part of the BLAH6 hackathon, we extended the TextAE platform to allow visualization and annotation of non-contiguous entities. This enables users to add new subspans to existing entities by selecting additional text. We integrate this new functionality with TextAE’s existing editing functionality to allow easy changes to entity annotation and editing of relation annotations involving non-contiguous entities, with importing and exporting to the PubAnnotation format. Finally, we roughly quantify the problem across the entire accessible biomedical literature to highlight that there are a substantial number of non-contiguous entities that appear in lists that would be missed by most text mining systems.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The parasite preferentially infects subcutaneous tissue, but may invade the central nervous system, resulting in neurocysticercosis (NC). NC is an important neglected tropical disease and an emerging disease in industrialized countries due to immigration from endemic areas. The prevalence of taeniasis in Korea declined from 0.3%-12.7% during the 1970s to below 0.02% since the 2000s. A survey conducted from 1993 to 2006 revealed that the percentage of tested samples with high levels of specific anti-TsM antibody declined from 8.3% to 2.2%, suggesting the continuing occurrence of NC in Korea. Modern imaging modalities have substantially improved the diagnostic accuracy of NC, and recent advances in the molecular biochemical characterization of the TsM cyst fluid proteome also significantly strengthened NC serodiagnosis. Two glycoproteins of 150 and 120 kDa that induce strong antibody responses against sera from patients with active-stage NC have been elucidated. The 150 kDa protein showed hydrophobic-ligand binding activities and might be critically involved in the acquisition of host-derived lipid molecules. Fasciclin and endophilin B1, both of which play roles in the homeostatic functions of TsM, showed fairly high antibody responses against calcified NC cases. NC is now controllable and manageable. Further studies should focus on controlling late-onset intractable seizures and serological diagnosis of NC patients infected with few worms. This article briefly overviews diagnostic approaches and discusses current issues relating to NC serodiagnosis.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative combines over 100 controlled vocabularies into its own. However, the OHDSI vocabulary is limited in the sense that it combines multiple terminologies and does not provide a direct way to link them outside of their own self-contained scope. This issue makes the tasks of enriching feature sets by using external resources extremely difficult. In order to address these shortcomings, we have created a linked data version of the OHDSI vocabulary, connecting it with already established linked resources like bioportal, bio2rdf, etc. with the ultimate purpose of enabling the interoperability of resources previously foreign to the OHDSI universe.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

However, most biomedical relation extraction datasets do not seek to distinguish between a false and a negative relation among two biomedical entities. Furthermore, datasets created using distant supervision techniques also have some false negative relations that constitute undocumented/unknown relations (missing from a knowledge base). We propose to improve the distinction between these concepts, by revising a subset of the relations marked as false on the phenotype-gene relations corpus and give the first steps to automatically distinguish between the false (F), negative (N), and unknown (U) results. Our work resulted in a sample of 127 manually annotated FNU relations and a weighted-F1 of 0.5609 for their automatic distinction.

Many methods have been proposed to identify gene-gene interactions. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) is a well-known method for the detection of gene-gene interactions by reduction from genotypes of single-nucleotide polymorphism combinations to a binary variable with a value of high risk or low risk. This method has been widely expanded to own a specific objective. Among those expansions, fuzzy-MDR uses the fuzzy set theory for the membership of high risk or low risk and increases the detection rates of gene-gene interactions. Fuzzy-MDR is expanded by a maximum likelihood estimator as a new membership function in empirical fuzzy MDR (EFMDR). However, EFMDR is relatively slow, because it is implemented by R script language. Therefore, in this study, we implemented EFMDR using RCPP (c++ package) for faster executions. Our implementation for faster EFMDR, called EMMDR-Fast, is about 800 times faster than EFMDR written by R script only.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The OR is a G protein‒coupled receptor that binds the guanine nucleotide-binding Gαolf subunit and the Gβγ dimer to recognize a wide spectrum of organic compounds in accordance with its cognate ligand. Mammalian ORs were originally identified from the olfactory epithelium of rat. However, it has been recently reported that the expression of ORs is not limited to the olfactory organ.

We performed an age-stratified genome-wide association study using the Illumina HumanOmni1-Quad BeadChip data (296 cases vs. 1,000 controls) and a replication study (1,360 cases vs. 3,553 controls) in the Korean population. Among 26 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in replication study, only a rare nonsynonymous SNP (rs4365796: c.1106C＞T, p.Thr369Met) in the lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) gene was very significantly associated with KD in patients younger than 6 months of age (odds ratio [OR], 3.07; pcombined = 1.10 × 10-5), whereas no association of the same SNP was observed in any other age group of KD patients. The same SNP (rs4365796) in the LEF1 gene showed the same direction of risk effect in Japanese KD patients younger than 6 months of age, although the effect was not statistically significant (OR, 1.42; p = 0.397).

Metabolomics profiling was performed from plasma samples using liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A GSTM1 null polymorphism was identified in pharmacogenomics test and the drug concentrations was higher in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects. The apparent drug clearance was 13-fold lower in GSTM1 null subjects than GSTM1 functional subjects (p < 0.001). By metabolomics analysis, we identified that the study drug was metabolized by cysteinylglycine conjugation in GSTM functional subjects but those not in GSTM1 null subjects. The incidence rate and the severity of ADRs were higher in the GSTM1 null subjects than the GSTM1 functional subjects. Through the integrated omics analysis, we could understand the mechanism of inter-individual variability in drug exposure and in adverse response. In conclusion, integrated multi-omics analysis can be useful for elucidating the various characteristics of new drug candidates in early phase clinical trials.\\n BREAKS HERE'"

            "Progression of Aortic Arch Calcification Is Associated with Overall and Cardiovascular Mortality in Hemodialysis\n",
            "\n",
            "Background. Vascular calcification is common and associated with unfavorable outcomes among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Nevertheless, little is known whether the progression of vascular calcification outweighs the baseline calcification in association with overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods. This study included 140 maintenance HD patients. Vascular calcification was assessed using the aortic arch calcification (AoAC) score measured from chest radiographs at the baseline and the second year of follow-up. Progression of vascular calcification (ΔAoAC) was defined as the difference between the two measurements of AoAC. The association of ΔAoAC with overall and CV mortality was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results. During the mean follow-up period of 5.8 years, there were 49 (35%) overall mortality and 27 (19.3%) CV mortality. High brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was positively correlated with ΔAoAC, whereas old age was negatively correlated with ΔAoAC. In multivariate adjusted Cox analysis, increased ΔAoAC (per 1 unit), but not baseline AoAC, was significantly associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.183; 95% CI, 1.056–1.327; ) and CV mortality (HR, 1.194; 95% CI, 1.019–1.398; ). Conclusion. Progression of AoAC outperformed the baseline AoAC in association with increased risk of overall and CV mortality in HD patients. A regular follow-up of chest radiograph and AoAC score assessments are simple and cost-effective to identify the high-risk individuals of unfavorable outcomes in maintenance HD patients.\n",
            "A Trypanosoma cruzi Genome Tandem Repetitive Satellite DNA Sequence as a Molecular Marker for a LAMP Assay for Diagnosing Chagas’ Disease\n",
            "\n",
            "Chagas’ disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi which is endemic throughout Latin America and is spread by worldwide migration. Diagnosis is currently limited to serological and molecular techniques having variations regarding their sensitivity and specificity. This work was aimed at developing a new sensitive, applicable, and cost-effective molecular diagnosis technique for loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based detection of T. cruzi (Tc-LAMP). The results led to determining a highly homologous satellite repeat region (231 bp) among parasite strains as a molecular marker for diagnosing the disease. Tc-LAMP was performed correctly for detecting parasite DNA (5 fg for the CL Brener strain and 50 fg for the DM28, TcVI, and TcI strains). Assay results proved negative for DNA from 16 helminth species and 7 protozoa, including Leishmania spp. Tc-LAMP based on the highly repeated T. cruzi satellite region is thus proposed as an important alternative for diagnosing T. cruzi infection, overcoming other methods’ limitations such as their analytic capability, speed, and requiring specialized equipment or highly trained personnel. Tc-LAMP could be easily adapted for point-of-care testing in areas having limited resources.\n",
            "Assessing the Prognostic Performance of the Child-Pugh, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, and Albumin-Bilirubin Scores in Patients with Decompensated Cirrhosis: A Large Asian Cohort from Gastroenterology Department\n",
            "\n",
            "Background and Aim. Various methods, including the Child-Pugh score, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, the MELD combined with serum sodium concentration (MELD-Na) score, the integrated MELD (iMELD) score, and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, have been widely used for predicting the survival of decompensated cirrhosis (DeCi) patients. In this study, we defined and compared the prognostic value of these scores to predict mortality in DeCi patients. Methods. We performed a single-center, observational retrospective study and analyzed 456 DeCi patients who were hospitalized in the gastroenterology department. The biochemical examination results and demographic characteristics of the patients were obtained, and five scores were calculated upon admission after 24 hours. All patients were observed until death, loss to follow-up, or specific follow-up times (28 days, 90 days, and 6 months). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the ability of these methods to predict mortality in DeCi patients. Results. At 28 days, 90 days, and 6 months, the cumulative number of deaths was 50 (11.0%), 76 (16.6%), and 91 (19.9%), respectively. The scores were significantly higher in nonsurviving patients than in surviving patients. All scores yielded viable values in predicting 28-day, 90-day, and 6-month prognoses for DeCi patients. The areas under the ROC curve (AUROCs) of the ALBI score were higher than those of the other scores, which were only over 0.700 at 28 days. The AUROC of the MELD score was higher than that of the other scores, including the MELD-Na and iMELD scores, at 90 days and 6 months. Conclusion. All five methods (Child-Pugh score, MELD score, MELD-Na score, iMELD score, and ALBI score) provided a reliable prediction of mortality for both the short-term and long-term prognosis of patients with DeCi. The ALBI score may be particularly useful for assessing short-term outcomes, whereas the MELD score may be particularly useful for assessing long-term outcomes.\n",

            "\n",
            "Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of our study was to evaluate plasma and urinary levels of GDF-15 after pediatric renal transplantation (Rtx) and in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its associations to cardiovascular risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, GDF-15 was measured in plasma and urine from 53 children with a renal transplant and 83 children with CKD and related to cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, obesity, and cholesterol) and kidney function. Forty healthy children served as a control group. Plasma levels of GDF-15 (median and range) for a Tx (transplantation) cohort, CKD cohort, and healthy controls were, respectively, 865 ng/L (463-3039 ng/L), 508 ng/L (183-3279 ng/L), and 390 ng/L (306-657 ng/L). The CKD and Tx cohorts both had significantly higher GDF-15 levels than the control group (). Univariate associations between GDF-15 and hyperuricemia (), elevated triglycerides (), low HDL (), and obesity () were found. However, mGFR () and hemoglobin () were the only significant predictors of GDF-15 in an adjusted analysis. Urinary GDF-15/creatinine ratios were 448 ng/mmol (74–5013 ng/mmol) and 540 ng/mmol (5–14960 ng/mmol) in the Tx cohort and CKD cohort, respectively. In the CKD cohort, it was weakly correlated to mGFR (, ). Plasma levels of GDF-15 are elevated in children with CKD and after Rtx. The levels were not associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors but strongly associated with renal function.\n",

            "\n",
            "Background. sST2 represents a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with heart failure, but limited data is available on its role in patients with hypertension. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-term prognosis value of sST2 for an unfavorable outcome in hypertensive patients. Methods. This was a prospective observational study which enrolled 80 patients with hypertension, who were followed for one year. All patients underwent clinical, laboratory (including sST2), and echocardiographic assessment at baseline. The patients were grouped according to the cardiovascular (CV) events reported during the follow-up: group A (with CV events) and group B (without CV events). Results. Overall, 59 CV events were reported during the follow-up period. Compared to group B, the patients in group A had significantly higher sST2 levels, a higher number of CV risk factors, and a higher left ventricle mass. Except for the diastolic dysfunction parameters, the echocardiographic findings were similar in the two groups. Patients in group A had a lower  ratio, larger deceleration time, and increased telediastolic pressure as quantified by the  ratio than those in group B. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sST2 and fasting plasma glucose at baseline were independent predictors for the CV events reported during the follow-up period.  were associated with poor clinical outcomes (, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Conclusions. sST2 levels were correlated with the risk of adverse CV outcomes in hypertensive patients and may represent a useful prognostic marker in these patients.\n",
            "Functional Characterization of a Missense Variant of MLH1 Identified in Lynch Syndrome Pedigree\n",
            "\n",
            "Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRCs) inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. Here, we reported a multigeneration Chinese family clinically diagnosed with LS according to the Amsterdam II criteria. To identify the underlying causative gene for LS in this family, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed. A germline missense variant (c.2054C>T:p.S685F) in exon 18 of MLH1 was successfully identified by WES. Sanger sequencing verified the results of WES and also confirmed the cosegregation of the MLH1 missense variant in all affected members of the family including two unaffected family members. Bioinformatic tools predicted the identified MLH1 variant as deleterious. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed loss of MLH1 and PMS2 protein expression. In vitro expression analysis also revealed that the identified MLH1 missense variant (c.2054C>T:p.S685F) results in reduced expression of both MLH1 and PMS2 proteins. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the missense mutation c.2054C>T in MLH1 was classified as a “pathogenic” variant. Two unaffected family members were later recommended for colonoscopy and other important cancer diagnostic inspections every 1-2 years as both were at higher risk of LS. In conclusion, our findings widen the genotypic spectrum of MLH1 mutations responsible for LS. This study increases the phenotypic spectrum of LS which will certainly help the clinicians in diagnosing LS in multigeneration families. This study also puts emphasis on the importance of genetic counselling for the benefit of asymptomatic carriers of MMR gene variants who are at higher risk of LS.\n",
            "New Insights into the Role of Tyro3, Axl, and Mer Receptors in Rheumatoid Arthritis\n",
            "\n",
            "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease involving joints. Among several pathogenic mechanisms, the impairment of homeostatic regulators of inflammation seems to be critically important to sustain persistent infiltration and activation of immune and stromal cells within the diseased synovium. Tyrosine kinase receptors Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are members of the TAM family. Upon binding their ligands Growth Arrest-Specific gene 6 (Gas6) and Protein S (ProS1), TAM receptors (TAMs) exert numerous and diverse biologic functions. Activated Axl and Mer, for instance, can negatively regulate the inflammatory cascade and mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, contributing to prevent the development of autoimmunity. Thus, a role for TAMs has been hypothesized in RA. In this review, we will summarise unmet clinical needs in RA, depict the biology of TAMs and TAM ligands, focussing on their ability to regulate the immune system and inflammation cascade, and finally offer an overview of the state-of-the-art literature about the putative role of TAM axis in RA.\n",

            "\n",
            "Background. The safety and effectiveness of robotic surgery are evaluated by comparing perioperative outcomes with laparoscopy and laparotomy in endometrial cancer. Method. PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, and other databases were searched for eligible studies up to April 2019. Studies that compared robotic surgery with laparoscopy or laparotomy in surgical staging of endometrial cancer were included. The pooled odds ratio and weighted mean difference were calculated using a random-effects or a fixed-effects model to summarize the results. Results. Twenty-seven articles were ultimately included, with one randomized controlled trial and 26 observational studies. A total of 6568 patients were included. Meta-analysis showed that robotic surgery had less estimated blood loss (), blood transfusion (), intraoperative complications (), and conversion to open surgery (), and a shorter hospital stay (), but had a longer operation time () in surgical staging of endometrial cancer compared with laparoscopy. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications, the total number of lymph nodes harvested, the number of pelvic lymph nodes harvested, and the number of para-aortic lymph nodes harvested between techniques. Robotic surgery had a longer operation time (), less estimated blood loss (), blood transfusion (), and postoperative complications (), and a shorter hospital stay () compared with laparotomy. There were no significant differences in other variables between techniques. Conclusion. Robotic surgery is a safer surgical approach than laparoscopy and laparotomy in surgical staging of endometrial cancer, with less estimated blood loss, blood transfusion, and conversion, and the same number of lymph nodes harvested.\n",
            "The Accuracy of Single MicroRNAs in Peripheral Blood to Diagnose Ovarian Cancer: An Updated Meta-Analysis\n",
            "\n",
            "Background. Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of death of women due to cancer in the United States. Although carbohydrate antigen 125 has a moderate diagnostic utility, the phenomenon of false-positive exists. As novel effective biomarkers, some single microRNAs (miRNAs) have diagnostic values for ovarian cancer, but the results lack consistency. In order to precisely and comprehensively assess the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer, a meta-analysis is performed. Methods. Articles concerning the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer were searched from databases. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Area under curve (AUC) of the summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curve was also calculated. Results. In total, 22 studies including 8 kinds of single miRNAs were enrolled in this paper (6 studies for miR-200c, 3 studies for miR-200a and miR-200b, and 2 studies for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b). For miR-200c, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.768 (95% CI: 0.722-0.811) and 0.680 (95% CI: 0.624-0.732); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 2.897 (95% CI: 1.787-4.698) and 0.340 (95% CI: 0.276-0.417); the pooled DOR was 8.917 (95% CI: 4.521-17.587); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.815. For miR-200a, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.759 (95% CI: 0.670-0.833) and 0.717 (95% CI: 0.627-0.795); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 3.129 (95% CI: 0.997-9.816) and 0.301 (95% CI: 0.207-0.437); the pooled DOR was 11.323 (95% CI: 3.493-36.711); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.857. For miR-200b, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.853 (95% CI: 0.776-0.912) and 0.775 (95% CI: 0.690-0.846); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 4.327 (95% CI: 0.683-27.415) and 0.225 (95% CI: 0.081-0.625); the pooled DOR was 19.678 (95% CI: 2.812-137.72); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.90. For miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b, each diagnostic value should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies were included. Conclusions. miR-200c, miR-200a, and miR-200b can be useful diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer. More related studies are needed for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b.\n",

            "\n",
            "The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia (PE) and preventative strategies remain unknown. Laboratory markers which can help in identifying PE patients from pregnant women and assessing the severity of PE during pregnancy are worthy to be explored. In this study, a retrospective case-control study was designed to assess whether the serum levels of albumin (ALB), total protein (TP), prealbumin (PA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, fibrinogen (Fbg), platelet (PLT) count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width (PDW) can help in assessing PE and evaluate its severity. 256 pregnant women were enrolled and classified into 3 groups: mild preeclampsia (mPE, ), severe preeclampsia (sPE, ), and healthy normotensive controls (control, ). Our result showed that the serum levels of ALP, LDH, and D-dimer were significantly higher in mild or severe PE patients compared with the healthy controls (66 (52.5-76.5) vs. 168 (141.5-201.25) vs. 182.5 (120-191.5), 152 (139.75-166.25) vs. 183.5 (163.25-307) vs. 282 (215.25-306), 1.05 (0.65-1.57) vs. 3.05 (2.25-4.08) vs. 5.65 (2.29-7.71)), while ALB, TP, and PA are lower (38 (37-42) vs. 31.5 (25.5-34.5) vs. 28.5 (24-33), 65 (63-68.25) vs. 56.5 (52-61) vs. 51.5 (49-58),  vs.  vs. ). On the other hand, compared with the mPE group, the sPE group showed significantly lower PLT count but higher level of LDH, D-dimer, and Fbg. No significant differences in MPV or PDW were found between any of the two groups. In conclusion, the above markers except for the MPV and PDW may be correlated with PE severity in this patient cohort, indicating possible values of these potential biomarkers in auxiliary diagnosis and severity assessment of PE.\n",

            "Objective. To evaluate the diagnostic value of low-dose 256-slice CT angiography (CTA), MR angiography (MRA), and three dimensional-digital subtraction angiography (3D-DSA) in cerebral aneurysms. Methods. CTA, MRA, and 3D-DSA were performed in all enrolled patients to explore the diagnostic significance of the three different examinations. Results. There were 92 aneurysms confirmed during DSA and surgery in 79 patients. The diagnostic coincidence rates of DSA, CTA, and MRA were 96.7%, 89.1%, and 86%, respectively. The diagnostic coincidence rates of CTA and MRA were lower than those of DSA. The detection rate of CTA for aneurysms less than 3 mm in diameter was higher than that of MRA. Conclusion. CTA, DSA, and MRA have their own advantages and disadvantages in the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms. They all have the diagnostic value for aneurysms.\n",

            "Backgrounds. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) has been regarded as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we evaluated FASN expression at both mRNA and protein levels and assessed the association between FASN expression and prognosis in male Han Chinese with PCa treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods. Expression profile and prognostic value of FASN were analyzed in tissue microarray (TMA) and data retrieved from databases including TCGA public database, GEO database, and our sequencing data with whole clinicopathological characteristics. Results. FASN expression was associated with clinical parameters and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. The relative expression of FASN mRNA was higher in the tumor tissue in all public databases and our sequencing data (). A similar result was seen in tissue microarray (TMA) (). Analysis of our sequencing data indicated that FASN’s relative expression was associated with tumor stage (), and FASN expression was positively associated with the Gleason score () and seminal vesicle invasion () in TMA. We found that high FASN expression was an independent predictor of shorter BCR-free survival with univariate and multivariate survival analysis (), rendering FASN an optimal prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with prostate cancer. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that FASN was overexpressed at mRNA and protein levels in PCa. We found that patients with high FASN expression had a shorter BCR-free survival, showing its value as a prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with PCa.\n",
            "Diet Alters Serum Metabolomic Profiling in the Mouse Model of Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy\n",
            "\n",
            "Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi which is endemic in Latin America. T. cruzi infection results in a latent infection with approximately a third of latently infected patients developing chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM). CCM is a common cause of cardiomyopathy in endemic regions and has a poor prognosis compared to other cardiomyopathies. The factors responsible for the transition from the asymptomatic indeterminate latent stage of infection to CCM are poorly understood. Our previous studies demonstrated that lipid metabolism and diet are important determinants of disease progression. In the present study, we analyzed various serum metabolomic biomarkers such as acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids in murine models of CCM, where the mice specifically develop either left or right ventricular cardiomyopathy based on the diets fed during the indeterminate stage in a murine model of Chagas disease. Our data provide new insights into the metabolic changes that may predispose patients to CCM and biomarkers that may help predict the risk of developing cardiomyopathy from T. cruzi infection. Author Summary. Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) is a parasitic disease prevalent in Latin America. Currently, no effective drugs or vaccines are available to prevent or cure CCM. The factors involved in the disease severity and progression are poorly understood to design new therapeutic interventions. In order to rapidly identify Chagas patients with a higher risk to develop CCM, a new set of biomarkers specific to Chagas disease is needed. We performed serum metabolomic analyses in chronic T. cruzi-infected mice fed on different diets and identified cardiac ventricular-specific metabolite biomarkers that could define CCM severity. In this paper, we present the results of serum metabolomic analyses and discuss its correlations to the diet-induced metabolic regulations in the pathogenesis of CCM in a murine model of Chagas disease.\n",

            "\n",
            "The current study demonstrates that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif- (ADAMTS-) 5 is a key extracellular matrix protease and associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels and relevance of coronary artery disease (CAD) remain largely unknown. This study is aimed at examining the relationship between the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels and the severity of coronary stenosis in patients with CAD. In the present study, the expression of ADAMTS-5 was analyzed in coronary artery samples and blood. The results showed that the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels were lower in the CAD group than in the control group. In addition, significantly higher matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 2 and MMP-9 levels were also observed in the patients with CAD, and the ADAMTS-5 levels were negatively correlated with the MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the Gensini score was negatively correlated with the ADAMTS-5 levels but was positively correlated with the MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that ADAMTS-5, MMP-2, and MMP-9 may have a certain diagnostic value in CAD and that the combination of all three metalloproteinases had a higher diagnostic value. The findings provided a better understanding of the role of ADAMTS-5 in the diagnosis of CAD.\n",

            "\n",
            "Objective. To investigate ultrasonographically the salivary glands and to correlate ultrasonographic parameters with focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and stimulated salivary flow rate. Material and Methods. 32 patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) and 32 healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study, performed in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, “Victor Babeș” University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timișoara, Romania. All the patients and controls were examined by salivary gland ultrasonography (B-mode, color and spectral Doppler, and sonoelastography), determining the following parameters: salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) score, resistive index (RI) of transverse facial artery, and shear wave velocity (SWV). Serum beta-2-microglobulin and stimulated saliva amount were determined in all the patients and controls. Minor salivary gland biopsy with focus score assessment was done in pSS patients. Results. Patients with pSS presented higher SGUS score and parotid and submandibular SWV and reduced RI of transverse facial artery than controls (). In pSS patients, statistically significant correlations were identified between assessed ultrasonographic parameters and focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and respective stimulated saliva flow (). Conclusions. This study highlighted statistically significant correlations between salivary gland ultrasonographic parameters and focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and stimulated saliva flow.\n",
            "Favorable Response to CD34+ Cell Therapy Is Associated with a Decrease of Galectin-3 Levels in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure\n",
            "\n",
            "Background. Galectin-3 plasma levels (gal-3) were shown to correlate with the scar burden in chronic heart failure (CHF) setting. As scar burden predicts response to stem cell therapy, we sought to explore a correlation between gal-3 and response to CD34+ cell transplantation in patients with CHF. Methods. We performed a post hoc analysis of patients, enrolled in 2 prospective trials investigating the clinical effects of CD34+ cell therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). CD34+ cells were mobilized by G-CSF, collected via apheresis, and injected transendocardially using NOGA system. Patients were followed for 3 months and demographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical parameters and gal-3 were analyzed at baseline and at follow-up. Response to cell therapy was defined as an LVEF increase of ≥5%. Results. 61 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 52 years and 83% were male. DCMP and ICMP were present in 69% and 31% of patients, respectively. The average serum creatinine was  μmol/L, NT-proBNP 1132 (IQR 350-2279) pg/mL, and LVEF %. Gal-3 at baseline and at 3 months did not differ significantly ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ), and there were no differences in baseline gal-3 with respect to heart failure etiology ( ng/mL in ICMP vs.  ng/mL in DCMP; ). Comparing responders () to nonresponders (), we found no differences in baseline gal-3 ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ). However, responders had significantly lower gal-3 at 3-month follow-up ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ). Also, responders demonstrated a significant decrease in gal-3 over 3 months, while in nonresponders, an increase in gal-3 occurred ( ng/mL vs. ng/mL; ). Conclusions. In patients with chronic heart failure undergoing CD34+ cell therapy, a decrease in galectin-3 plasma levels is associated with beneficial response to this treatment modality. Further prospective data is warranted to confirm our findings and to deepen our understanding of the role of gal-3 in the field of stem cell therapy.\n",
            "Circulating MicroRNAs as Novel Potential Biomarkers for Left Ventricular Remodeling in Postinfarction Heart Failure\n",
            "\n",
            "Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as potential biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling in postinfarction heart failure (HF). However, the diagnostic reproducibility of the use of circulating miRNAs may be affected by the temporal expression of miRNAs following myocardial infarction (MI). In the current study, using a MI-induced HF rat cohort (4-, 8-, and 12-week post-MI groups), we investigated the temporal expression of plasma miRNAs during the development of left ventricular remodeling. The plasma miRNA expression profile was obtained using miRNA sequencing. The expression of candidate miRNAs in plasma and tissues was examined with real-time PCR. Target genes of candidate miRNAs were predicted using a parallel miRNA-messenger RNA expression profiling approach. The value of plasma miRNAs as biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling was evaluated in patients with postinfarction HF () and control patients with stable angina and without significant coronary lesions and HF () with real-time PCR. Although the expression levels of miR-20a-5p, miR-340-5p, and let-7i-5p were temporally regulated in plasma, myocardium, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression levels of plasma miRNAs, especially miR-20a-5p, were associated with the development of left ventricular remodeling in the postinfarction HF rat cohort. The target genes of these 3 miRNAs were associated with the mechanistic target of rapamycin, nuclear factor-κB, tumour necrosis factor, apoptosis, and p53 signaling pathways. Additionally, the plasma levels of miR-20a-5p, miR-340-5p, and let-7i-5p were significantly increased in patients with postinfarction HF. However, only the expression levels of miR-20a-5p presented significant positive correlations with left ventricular internal end diastolic dimension and left ventricular end diastolic volume. In conclusion, the expression levels of plasma miR-20a-5p were significantly associated with the degree of left ventricular dilatation, and plasma miR-20a-5p may be a potential biomarker for postinfarction left ventricular remodeling.\n",
            "Cardiac Chagas Disease: MMPs, TIMPs, Galectins, and TGF-β as Tissue Remodelling Players\n",
            "\n",
            "A century after the discovery of Chagas disease, studies are still needed to establish the complex pathophysiology of this disease. However, it is known that several proteins and molecules are related to the establishment of this disease, its evolution, and the appearance of its different clinical forms. Metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, galectins, and TGF-β are involved in the process of infection and consequently the development of myocarditis, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis upon infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. Thus, considering that the heart is one of the main target organs in Chagas disease, knowledge regarding the mechanisms of action of these molecules is essential to understand how they interact and trigger local and systemic reactions and, consequently, determine whether they contribute to the development of Chagas’ heart disease. In this sense, it is believed that the inflammatory microenvironment caused by the infection alters the expression of these proteins favoring progression of the host-parasite cycle and thereby stimulating cardiac tissue remodeling mechanisms and fibrosis. The aim of this review was to gather information on metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, galectins, and TGF-β and discuss how these molecules and their different interrelationships contribute to the development of Chagas’ heart disease.\n",
            "The Crucial Role of CXCL8 and Its Receptors in Colorectal Liver Metastasis\n",
            "\n",
            "CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) can produce different biological effects by binding to its receptors: CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). CXCL8 and its receptors are associated with the development of various tumor types, especially colorectal cancer and its liver metastases. In addition to promoting angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, migration, and the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, CXCL8 and its receptors have also been known to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells, to help them to escape host immunosurveillance as well as to enhance resistance to anoikis, which promotes the formation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and their colonization of distant organs. In this paper, we will review the established roles of CXCL8 signaling in CRC and discuss the possible strategies of targeting CXCL8 signaling for overcoming CRC drug resistance and cancer progression, including direct targeting of CXCL8/CXCR1/2 or indirect targeting through the inhibition of CXCL8-CXCR1/2 signaling.\n",

            "\n",
            "Aims. Early detection of patients at high risk for progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery remains a major challenge. We aim to evaluate the utility of urinary matrix metalloproteinase-7 (uMMP-7) and other reported biomarkers for predicting AKI progression during postoperative hospital stay. Methods. We conducted a prospective, multicenter cohort study in 121 adult patients with stage 1 or 2 AKI after cardiac surgery. uMMP-7 and other well-reported biomarkers (uIL-18, uNGAL, and UACR) were measured at time of AKI clinical diagnosis. The primary outcome is the progression of AKI after cardiac surgery, defined as worsening of AKI stage (stage 1 to either stage 2 or stage 3 or from stage 2 to stage 3). Results. A level of  at time of AKI diagnosis conveyed an 8-fold risk of AKI progression as compared to those with  after adjusting for clinical risk factors. The performance of uMMP-7 for predicting progressive AKI was good with an AUC of 0.80. The combination of uMMP-7 and IL-18 produces the greatest AUC for predicting progressive AKI. Addition of uMMP-7 to the clinical risk factor model significantly improved risk reclassification for AKI progression. Conclusions. uMMP-7, measured at time of AKI clinical diagnosis, is a novel biomarker for predicting the progression of AKI after cardiac surgery. Adding uMMP-7 to the clinical risk factor model may be used as a noninvasive approach to identify a subpopulation that is at high risk for progressive AKI after cardiac surgery.\n",
            "Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Pregnancy with Intrauterine Growth Restriction: A Pilot Study\n",
            "\n",
            "Objective. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a major cause of late stillbirth, though not all compromised babies remain small or are considered growth restricted as pregnancy progresses. Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (f-MRI) represents a second-line tool to study pregnancies with IUGR fetuses. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of f-MRI on predicting fetal growth and the offspring’s perinatal respiratory outcome. Design. All f-MRI performed between 2014 and 2016 in Siena were analysed. Pregnancies with IUGR (Study group (SG)) were recruited together with a control population (Control group (CG)), coupled for gestational age (GA) at the time of f-MRI (mean GA 31 wks). Neonatal information was collected. The f-MRI protocol consisted of T2w images. Six regions of interest (ROI) were placed as follows: 2 on the lung, 2 on the liver, and 2 on the amniotic fluid. The signal intensities (SI) of each ROI were measured. The SI lung to liver ratio (SI lung/liver) and SI lung to amniotic fluid ratio (SI lung/amniotic fluid) were obtained for each fetus. Each ratio was compared between SG and CG. Therefore, SG was divided into two subgroups: adequate and small for gestational age (AGA and SGA) newborns. All measurements were related to offspring’s perinatal respiratory outcome. Results. SI lung/liver was linearly related with GA at the time of f-MRI and with EFW. SI lung/amniotic fluid was significantly higher in SG than in CG (). In contrast, among SG, lower values of SI lung/amniotic fluid were found in the SGA compared to AGA (). The days of oxygen supply were higher in the SGA subgroup than in the AGA subgroup (). Conclusions. SI lung/liver increases with fetal lung maturation and appears to be useful to estimate intrauterine fetal growth. SI lung/amniotic fluid seems to be a reliable predictive index to distinguish the IUGR fetuses that can recover their growth from those that were born SGA. f-MRI represents a promising frontier to predict IUGR fetus outcome, thus contributing to ameliorate the perinatal management.\n",
            "Prognostic Value of MicroRNAs in Patients after Myocardial Infarction: A Substudy of PRAGUE-18\n",
            "\n",
            "Background. The evaluation of the long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an established clinical process. Laboratory markers may significantly help with the risk stratification of these patients. Our objective was to find the relation of selected microRNAs to the standard markers of AMI and determine if these microRNAs can be used to identify patients at increased risk. Methods. Selected microRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499) were measured in a cohort of 122 patients from the PRAGUE-18 study (ticagrelor vs. prasugrel in AMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI)). The cohort was split into two subgroups: 116 patients who did not die (survivors) and 6 patients who died (nonsurvivors) during the 365-day period after AMI. Plasma levels of selected circulating miRNAs were then assessed in combination with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Results. miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 correlated positively with NT-proBNP and hsTnT 24 hours after admission and negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Both miR-1 and miR-133a positively correlated with hsTnT at admission. Median relative levels of all selected miRNAs were higher in the subgroup of nonsurvivors () in comparison with survivors (), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. All patients in the nonsurvivor subgroup had miR-499 and NT-proBNP levels above the cut-off values (891.5 ng/L for NT-proBNP and 0.088 for miR-499), whereas in the survivor subgroup, only 28.4% of patients were above the cut-off values (). Conclusions. Statistically significant correlation was found between miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 and hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and LVEF. In addition, this analysis suggests that plasma levels of circulating miR-499 could contribute to the identification of patients at increased risk of death during the first year after AMI, especially when combined with NT-proBNP levels.\n",

            "\n",
            "Background and Objectives. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a silent disease characterised by aortic wall expansion and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dedifferentiation from contractile to synthetic phenotype. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in VSMC phenotypic regulation could be considered as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets of TAA. In vitro studies show that lncRNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, MALAT1, and SMILR are associated with the VSMC phenotypic state. Our aim was to test if these lncRNAs are dysregulated during TAA formation in clinical patient samples. Materials and Methods. Relative expression of lncRNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, SMILR, and MALAT1 was tested in clinical aortic tissue and blood plasma samples from TAA and non-TAA patients using the qRT-PCR method. The Mann–Whitney  test was used to compare ΔCt values between the study groups. ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of plasma lncRNAs. Results. We found significantly reduced CARMN () and LUCAT1 () expression in aortic tissue samples from TAA patients. Relative expression of MALAT1 () and SMILR () did not differ in aortic tissue between the TAA and non-TAA groups. Expression of both LUCAT1 and SMILR was significantly decreased in TAA patients’ blood plasma compared to controls ( and , respectively). However, only LUCAT1 showed the ability to discriminate aneurysmal disease in patients’ blood plasma (, , ). Conclusions. We have shown that the expression of lncRNAs CARMN and LUCAT1 is reduced in dilated aortic tissue and that the LUCAT1 and SMILR expression is lower in the blood plasma of TAA patients. Decreased LUCAT1 expression in TAA patients’ blood plasma may have diagnostic potential in discriminating patients with TAA.\n",
            "Association of Plasma Renalase and Left Ventricle Mass Index in Heart Failure Patients Stratified to the Category of the Ejection Fraction: A Pilot Study\n",
            "\n",
            "Heart failure represents a growing health problem, with increasing morbidity and mortality globally. According to the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure, many biomarkers have been proposed for the timely diagnosis and prognostication of patients with heart failure, but other than natriuretic peptides, none of them has gained enough clinical significance. Renalase, a new protein derived from kidneys was demonstrated to metabolize catecholamines and to have a cardioprotective role. The aim of the study was to determine whether renalase and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration could be used to differentiate heart failure patients stratified to the category of the ejection fraction and whether plasma renalase could be used as a biomarker for left ventricle hypertrophy in all subgroups of heart failure patients. We included patients diagnosed with heart failure and stratified them to the three subgroups according to the ejection fraction. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, HFmrEF had an intermediate profile in between HFrEF and HFpEF, with statistical significance in most evaluated parameters. BNP concentration was significantly different in all three subgroups (), and renalase was statistically higher in HFrEF () compared to the HFmrEF and HFpEF, where its results were similar, without statistical significance. Renalase plasma concentration was demonstrated to be highly and positively associated with left ventricle mass index in HFrEF (), as well as increased plasma concentration of BNP (). In the HFmrEF group of patients, body mass index was positively associated with LVMI (), while in the patients with HFpEF, diabetes mellitus was demonstrated to have a positive association with LVMI (). These findings suggest that renalase concentration may be measured in order to differentiate patients with reduced ejection fraction. Plasma renalase concentrations positively correlated with left ventricle hypertrophy in patients with reduced ejection fraction, being strongly associated with increased left ventricular mass index.\n",
            "Vitamin D Deficiency Predicts Poor Clinical Outcomes in Heart Failure Patients Undergoing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy\n",
            "\n",
            "Background and Aims. Resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves mortality and induces reverse remodeling in heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction and wide QRS. Nonetheless, some patients do not improve despite the optimal medical therapy and right indications for device implantation. Therefore, finding biomarkers suitable for identification of those patients is crucial. Vitamin D plays a classic hormonal role in the regulation of bone metabolism and also has physiological functions in wide range of nonskeletal tissues. Based on recent studies, low levels of vitamin D seem to directly contribute to pathogenesis and worsening of HF. We planned to assess the role of vitamin D levels on clinical outcomes of HF patients undergoing CRT. Methods and Results. We enrolled 136 HF patients undergoing CRT. Total plasma vitamin D levels were measured at baseline and 6 months later. Primary endpoint was 5-year all-cause mortality; secondary endpoint was lack of good clinical response, defined as less than 15% increase of left ventricular ejection fraction after six months. During follow-up, 58 patients reached the primary, and 45 patients reached the secondary endpoint. Vitamin D levels less than 24.13 ng/mL predicted 5-year mortality () and poor clinical response () after adjusting to all significant baseline predictors. Conclusion. Our study showed that vitamin D deficiency has a significant impact in heart failure patients; it is an independent predictor of lack of midterm clinical response and long-term mortality in patients undergoing CRT. Therefore, monitoring vitamin D status of heart failure patients could be of clinical significance.\n",

            "\n",
            "Purpose. To investigate the association of galectin-3 (Gal-3) and soluble ST2 (sST2) and their follow-up changes with the development of heart failure (HF) and echocardiographic parameters of HF (ejection fraction, atrial and ventricular size, left ventricular hypertrophy, e, and E/e) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). Methods. A prospective, observational study, BIOSTRAT (Biomarkers for Risk Stratification After STEMI), enrolled 117 patients between October 2014 and April 2017. Gal-3 and sST2 serum collection and echocardiography were performed twice (during index hospitalization and on a control visit at one-year follow-up). The primary endpoint was HF onset at one-year follow-up. Secondary assessments included associations of biomarker concentration with echocardiographic indices of systolic and diastolic dysfunction at baseline and at one year. Results. Mean baseline concentrations of Gal-3 and sST2 (7.5 and 26.4 ng/mL, respectively) were significantly increased at one-year follow-up (8.5 ng/mL and  and 31.4 ng/mL and , respectively). Patients who reached the primary endpoint (50 patients (48%)) had significantly higher baseline concentrations of both biomarkers and a higher Gal-3 level at one year compared to patients who did not. Both Gal-3 and sST2 were predictors of the primary endpoint in univariate logistic regression analysis, but only Gal-3 remained significant in multivariate analysis. There was no clear association between both biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters. Conclusions. Baseline, but not one-year, changes of Gal-3 and sST2 concentrations may be useful for risk stratification after STEMI. However, only Gal-3 was the independent predictor of HF development at one-year observation. This trial is registered with NCT03735719.\n",

            "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an irreversible loss of kidney function, and it represents a major global public health burden due to both its prevalence and its continuously increasing incidence. Mineral bone disorders (MBDs) constitute a hallmark of CKD, and alongside cardiovascular complications, they underlie a poor prognosis for these patients. Thus, our study focused on novel CKD biomarker patterns and their impact on the clinical staging of the disease. As a first testing approach, the relative expression levels of 105 proteins were assessed by the Proteome Profiler Cytokine Array Kit for pooled CKD stage 2–4 serum samples to establish an overall view regarding the proteins involved in CKD pathogenesis. Among the molecules that displayed significant dysregulation in the CKD stages, we further explored the involvement of Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk-1), a recognised inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway, and its crosstalk with 1,25OH2D3 (calcitriol) as new players in renal bone and vascular disease. The serum levels of these two molecules were quantified by an ELISA (76 samples), and the results reveal decreasing circulating levels of Dkk-1 and calcitriol in advanced CKD stages, with their circulating expression showing a downward trend as the CKD develops. In the next step, we analysed the inflammation and MBD biomarkers’ expression in CKD (by xMAP array). Our results show that the molecules involved in orchestrating the inflammatory response, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), as well as the mineral biomarkers osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OPN), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), correlate with Dkk-1 and calcitriol, raising the possibility of them being potential useful CKD biomarkers. These results reveal the impact of different biomarker patterns in CKD staging and severity, thus opening up novel approaches to be explored in CKD clinical management.\n",

            "\n",
            "Liver fibrosis consists in the accumulation of extracellular matrix components mainly derived from activated hepatic stellate cells. This is commonly the result of chronic liver injury repair and represents an important health concern. As liver biopsy is burdened with many drawbacks, not surprisingly there is great interest to find new reliable noninvasive methods. Among the many are new potential fibrosis biomarkers under study, some of the most promising represented by the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) serum protein and its family of tyrosine kinase receptors, namely, Tyro3, Axl, and MERTK (TAM). Gas6/TAM system (mainly, Axl and MERTK) has in fact recently emerged as an important player in the progression of liver fibrosis. This review is aimed at giving an overall perspective of the roles played by these molecules in major chronic liver diseases. The most promising findings up to date acknowledge that both Gas6 and its receptor serum levels (such as sAxl and, probably, sMERTK) have been shown to potentially allow for easy and accurate measurement of hepatic fibrosis progression, also providing indicative parameters of hepatic dysfunction. Although most of the current scientific evidence is still preliminary and there are no in vivo validation studies on large patient series, it still looks very promising to imagine a possible future prognostic role for these biomarkers in the multidimensional assessment of a liver patient. One may also speculate on a potential role for this system targeting (e.g., with small molecule inhibitors against Axl) as a therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis management, always bearing in mind that any such therapeutic approach might face toxicity.\n",

            "\n",
            "Background. The ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to the global diastolic strain rate (E/E’sr) and global longitudinal systolic strain (GLS) of the left ventricle (LV) are emerging indices of diastolic and systolic functions, respectively, for the LV. Their prognostic significance in the prediction of mortality and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes remains underexplored in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods. This prospective study included 190 maintenance HD patients. The E/E’sr ratio and GLS were assessed using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. The clinical outcomes included overall mortality, CV mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The associations between the E/E’sr ratio, GLS, and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The incremental values of the E/E’sr ratio and GLS in outcome prediction were assessed by  changes in Cox models. Results. Over a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, there were 35 overall deaths, 16 CV deaths, and 45 MACE. Impaired diastolic function with a higher E/E’sr ratio was associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.484; 95% CI, 1.201−1.834; ), CV mortality (HR, 1.584; 95% CI, 1.058–2.371; ), and MACE (HR, 1.205; 95% CI, 1.040−1.397; ) in multivariate adjusted Cox analysis. Worsening GLS was associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.276; 95% CI, 1.101−1.480; ), CV mortality (HR, 1.513; 95% CI, 1.088−2.104; ), and MACE (HR, 1.214; 95% CI, 1.103−1.337; ). The E/E’sr ratio and GLS had better outcome prediction than the E to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/E’) ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Moreover, adding the E/E’sr ratio and GLS to Cox models containing relevant clinical and conventional echocardiographic parameters improved the prediction of overall mortality (), CV mortality (), and MACE (). Conclusion. The E/E’sr ratio and GLS, as emerging indices of LV diastolic and systolic functions, significantly predict mortality and CV outcomes and outperform conventional echocardiographic parameters in outcome prediction in HD patients.\n",

            "Purpose. This study is aimed at determining whether bone mineral density (BMD) values are related to atherogenic indexes (AIs) and could predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in southern Taiwanese adults. Methods. Medical records of 3249 adults who underwent health examinations between June 2014 and February 2018 at a regional hospital in southern Taiwan were reviewed. Data collected included health history, anthropomorphic characteristics, exercise habits, diets (vegetarian or nonvegetarian), clinical laboratory results (lipid profile, systemic blood pressure (SBP), glucose level, creatinine (Cre) level, and hemoglobin (Hb) level), and bone mineral density (BMD), which were used to identify the associations of these parameters, especially BMD, with lipid profile and calculated AIs through simple and multiple linear regressions. Results. The mean age of the patients was 58.0 years, and 71.4% were male. Body mass index (BMI), SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, and all BMD values were positively correlated with triglyceride (TG) level and AIs and were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. The significant positive correlations of BMD at all the measured sites with AIs remained after adjusting for age, sex, SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, smoking, exercise habits, and vegetarian state. The expanded adjusting model for TG/HDL-C remained significant at all the BMD measured sites in nonobese men, at bilateral femoral neck and total hips in nonobese women, and at the bilateral total hips in obese women. Conclusions. AIs are predictive markers for CVD, and BMD values are predictors of AIs, especially the novel AI, i.e., TG/HDL-C ratio, in nonobese adult men and women after dividing the patients into subgroups to eliminate the effect of BMI as a confounding factor. Thus, BMD values could predict AIs of CVD, especially in nonobese adults.\n",

            "\n",
            "Malignant germ cell tumors (GCT) are the most common malignant tumors in young men between 18 and 40 years. The correct identification of histological subtypes, in difficult cases supported by immunohistochemistry, is essential for therapeutic management. Furthermore, biomarkers may help to understand pathophysiological processes in these tumor types. Two GCT cell lines, TCam-2 with seminoma-like characteristics, and NTERA-2, an embryonal carcinoma-like cell line, were compared by a quantitative proteomic approach using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with stable isotope labelling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC). We were able to identify 4856 proteins and quantify the expression of 3936. 347 were significantly differentially expressed between the two cell lines. For further validation, CD81, CBX-3, PHF6, and ENSA were analyzed by western blot analysis. The results confirmed the MS results. Immunohistochemical analysis on 59 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) normal and GCT tissue samples (normal testis, GCNIS, seminomas, and embryonal carcinomas) of these proteins demonstrated the ability to distinguish different GCT subtypes, especially seminomas and embryonal carcinomas. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of these proteins resulted in an antiproliferative effect in TCam-2, NTERA-2, and an additional embryonal carcinoma-like cell line, NCCIT. In summary, this study represents a proteomic resource for the discrimination of malignant germ cell tumor subtypes and the observed antiproliferative effect after knockdown of selected proteins paves the way for the identification of new potential drug targets.\n",

            "\n",
            "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disorder of the myocardium in diabetic patients, which is one of the critical complications of diabetes giving rise to an increased mortality. However, the underlying mechanisms of DCM remain incompletely understood presently. This study was designed to screen the potential molecules and pathways implicated with DCM. GSE26887 involving 5 control individuals and 7 DCM patients was selected from the GEO database to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DAVID was applied to perform gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was also constructed to visualize the interactions among these DEGs. To further validate significant genes and pathways, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot were performed. A total of 236 DEGs were captured, including 134 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes. GO, KEGG, and the PPI network disclosed that inflammation, immune disorders, metabolic disturbance, and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly enriched in the development of DCM. Notably, IL6 was an upregulated hub gene with the highest connectivity degree, suggesting that it may interact with a great many molecules and pathways. Meanwhile, SOCS3 was also one of the top 15 hub genes in the PPI network. Herein, we detected the protein level of STAT3 and SOCS3 in a mouse model with DCM. Western blot results showed that the protein level of SOCS3 was significantly lower while phosphorylated-STAT3 (P-STAT3) was activated in mice with DCM. In vitro results also uncovered the similar alterations of SOCS3 and P-STAT3 in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts induced by high glucose (HG). However, overexpression of SOCS3 could significantly reverse HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen synthesis of cardiac fibroblasts. Taken together, our analysis unveiled potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in DCM, which could be helpful to the diagnosis and treatment of DCM.\n",
            "Evaluation of a Novel Missense Mutation in ABCB4 Gene Causing Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 3\n",
            "\n",
            "Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a hepatic disorder occurring predominantly in childhood and is difficult to diagnose. PFIC3, being a rare autosomal recessive disease, is caused by genetic mutations in both alleles of ABCB4, resulting in the disruption of the bile secretory pathway. The identification of pathogenic effects resulting from different mutations in ABCB4 is the key to revealing the internal cause of disease. These mutations cause truncation, instability, misfolding, and impaired trafficking of the MDR3 protein. Here, we reported a girl, with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis and progressive liver cirrhosis, with an elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase level. Genetic screening via whole exome sequencing found a novel homozygous missense mutation ABCB4:c.1195G>C:p.V399L, and the patient was diagnosed with PFIC3. Various computational tools predicted the variant to be deleterious and evolutionary conserved. For functional characterization studies, plasmids, encoding ABCB4 wild-type and selected established mutant constructs, were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. In vitro expression analysis observed a reduced expression of mutant protein compared to wild-type protein. We found that ABCB4 wild type was localized at the apical canalicular membrane, while mutant p.V399L showed intracellular retention. Intracellular mistrafficking proteins usually undergo proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. We found that after treatment with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1, MDR3 expression of V399L was significantly increased. A decrease in MDR3 expression of mutant V399L protein may be a result of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. Pharmacological modulator cyclosporin A and intracellular low temperature (30°C) treatment significantly rescued both the folding defect and the active maturation of the mutant protein. Our study identified a novel pathogenic mutation which expanded the mutational spectrum of the ABCB4 gene and may contribute to understanding the molecular basis of PFIC3. Therefore, genetic screening plays a conclusive role in the diagnosis of rare heterogenic disorders like PFIC3.\n",

            "\n",
            "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) drives several physiologic and pathologic cellular processes and is frequently deregulated in different types of tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). Despite recent advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in GBM biology, the survival rates of this tumor are still disappointing, primarily due to the lack of efficacious treatments. The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR pathway has emerged as a crucial player in GBM development and progression. However, to date, all the attempts to target this pathway with PI3K, AKT, or mTORC1 inhibitors failed to improve the outcome of patients with GBM. Despite these discouraging results, recent evidence pointed out that the blockade of mTORC2 might provide a useful therapeutic strategy for GBM, with the potential to overcome the limitations that mTORC1 inhibitors have shown so far. In this review, we analyzed the rationale of targeting mTOR in GBM and the available preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the choice of this therapeutic approach, highlighting the different roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in GBM biology.\n",

            "\n",
            "Mutations in the “guardian of the genome” TP53 predominate in solid tumors. In addition to loss of tumor suppressor activity, a specific subset of missense mutations confers additional oncogenic properties. These “gain-of-function” (GOF) mutations portend poor prognosis across cancer types regardless of treatment. Our objective in this study was to identify novel therapeutic opportunities to overcome the deleterious effects of GOF TP53 mutants. Using gynecologic cancer cell lines with known TP53 mutational status, we established that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor induced cell death in cells with two recurrent GOF TP53 mutations (R175H and R248Q), and addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) enhanced this effect. By contrast, p53-null cancer cells were relatively resistant to the combination. Proteasome inhibition promoted apoptosis of cells with TP53 GOF mutations, potentially through induction of the unfolded protein response. In line with the reported hyperstabilization of GOF p53 protein, cells treated with HDACi exhibited reduced levels of p53 protein. Together, these data form the basis for future clinical studies examining therapeutic efficacy in a preselected patient population with GOF TP53 mutations.\n",

            "Salivary biomarkers may offer a noninvasive and easy sampling alternative in cardiovascular risk evaluation. The aim of the present study was to establish associations of salivary potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphate levels with the cardiovascular phenotype determined by carotid ultrasound and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and to identify possible covariates for these associations.  samples of nonstimulated whole buccal saliva were obtained from subjects with (; 59%) or without (; 41%) hypertension. The potassium concentrations were 10-fold higher in saliva compared with plasma, whereas sodium concentrations exhibited the reverse relation between saliva and blood. There were no significant correlations between the levels of sodium, potassium, or calcium in saliva and plasma. All salivary electrolytes, except sodium, were significantly associated with age. In age-adjusted analyses, salivary potassium was significantly associated with carotid artery intima media thickness (cIMT) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and these associations were at the limit of significance in multivariate analyses including prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors. Body mass index was a significant confounder for salivary potassium. Salivary phosphate was significantly associated with cIMT in the multivariate analysis. Salivary potassium, calcium, and phosphate levels were significantly associated with heart rate in the univariate age-adjusted as well as in two different multivariate models, whereas no significant associations between sodium and heart rate were observed. In conclusion, the differential association of salivary electrolytes with cardiovascular phenotypes indicates that these electrolytes should be further studied for their predictive value as noninvasive biomarkers for cardiovascular risk evaluation.\n",

Thus, much more efforts in terms of diagnostics and treatments must be provided in the fight of these outcomes. In this sense, recently, the study of saliva as biological matrix has been identified as a new landmark initiative in the search of novel and useful biomarkers to prevent and diagnose these conditions. Specifically, saliva is a rich reservoir of different proteins and peptides and accessible due to recent advances in molecular biology and specially in targeted and unbiased proteomics technologies. Nonetheless, emerging barriers are an obstacle to the study of the salivary proteome in an effective way.

            "Objectives. Periodontal disease is prevalent and has an inflammation associated with not only oral but also systemic pathologies. The diagnosis by biomarkers is required for clinical practice on periodontal disease. The lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin were both inflammation-related molecules. The present study investigated the relationship between the periodontal status and the two biomarkers in gingival retention fluid (GRF). Patients and Methods. In 63 subjects with periodontitis, the GRF was sampled from maxillary anterior gingiva using a microbrush for 30 seconds. The lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin levels in GRF were measured by an enzyme-link solvent immunoassay. Periodontal status was evaluated by probing pocket depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Results. There was a higher level of these biomarkers in saliva (median (ng/mL), lactoferrin: 3611.9, α1-antitrypsin: 4573.3) than in GRF (lactoferrin: 61.0, α1-antitrypsin: 54.7). There was a mild-to-moderate but significantly positive correlation in lactoferrin or α1-antitrypsin between GRF and saliva. There was a positively mild-to-moderate accuracy (area under the curve: 0.60–0.81) of lactoferrin or α1-antitrypsin in GRF or in saliva to distinguish the severity of periodontal status. The cutoff level (ng/mL) of lactoferrin in GRF for detecting ≥30% of PD ≥ 4 mm (moderate periodontitis) was 68.6 and for detecting ≥20% of BOP (clinically active periodontitis) was 61.2. The cutoff level (ng/mL) of α1-antitrypsin in GRF for detecting ≥30% of PD ≥ 4 mm was 54.5 and for detecting ≥20% of BOP was 35.3. Conclusions. The data can promote an application of the measurements of lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin in GRF to clinical practice on periodontal disease.\n",

            "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among both women and men, but there is still a great percentage of misdiagnosis and lack of clearly defined criteria. Advances in biomolecular science have proven the crucial role of inflammation and, more importantly, the role of adipokines in mediating all stages of coronary artery disease. It has also been suggested that regional fat deposits, more precisely from thoracic region, have a major influence on the development of coronary artery disease by creating a local proatherogenic environment. The immune system closely interacts with metabolic risk factors to initiate, promote, and further aggravate the atherosclerotic lesions on the arterial wall all with the “help” of adipokines. So nowadays, research extensively focuses on uncovering biomarkers that would provide an increased chance of detecting subclinical cardiac distress and also add a consistent value to current guideline-imposed risk criteria.\n",

So far, multiple associations of adipokines with widespread noncommunicable diseases, including cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and fertility problems, have been identified. However, the precise mechanisms underlying empirically observed associations are still rather poorly understood, and more research must be carried out in order to make sense of and deepen the already published data.\n",

(Germany) in their work titled “Visfatin Serum Levels Predict Mortality in Critically Ill Patients” focused on the potential of visfatin to predict mortality of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Visfatin is an adipokine also called nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which displays insulin-mimicking effects. The authors report that the visfatin serum concentrations were strongly associated with disease severity and organ failure, irrespectively of the possible presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Moreover, the authors observed that visfatin levels correlated with biomarkers of renal failure, liver dysfunction, and other adipokines (e.g., resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in their cohort. Last but not least, high visfatin levels at ICU admission were predictive of an increased mortality, both at the ICU and during a long-term follow-up of approximately two years. Such findings emphasize strongly the need for a replication study of the potential of visfatin for the prediction of organ failure and/or overall survival in ICU patients.\n",

Wang et al. from China (manuscript titled “Circulating PGRN Levels Are Increased but Not Associated with Insulin Sensitivity or β-Cell Function in Chinese Obese Children”) investigated the association of progranulin with insulin sensitivity or β-cell function in a Chinese paediatric cohort, (ii) N. A. Abdella and O. A. Mojiminiyi from Kuwait (manuscript titled “Clinical Applications of Adiponectin Measurements in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Screening, Diagnosis, and Marker of Diabetes Control”) focused on adiponectin as a potential diagnostic marker for T2DM or insulin resistance, and (iii) P. Yan et al. from China (manuscript titled “Plasma Neuregulin 4 Levels Are Associated with Metabolic Syndrome in Patients Newly Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus”) investigated the link between neuregulin 4 and metabolic syndrome in newly diagnosed T2DM patients. Each of these works provides unique insights into the field, suggesting, respectively, that (i) progranulin is associated with higher BMI and multiple parameters of obesity in obese children, (ii) adiponectin may be useful as possible diagnostic/therapeutic markers in T2DM, and (iii) neuregulin 4 is associated with parameters of metabolic syndrome in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.\n",

All the included papers further highlight the importance of larger prospective studies as well as validation studies on different populations of patients and different ethnicities. To conclude, the presented special issue provides a collection of novel findings in the field, contributing possibly to better decision-making in the clinical practice. It should be kept in mind, however, that adipokines are part of large neuroendocrine-immune-metabolic networks, and they exert their effects through complex endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, or juxtacrine crosstalk mechanisms, which should be further investigated with system medicine approaches.\n",

            "Antecedents. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a frequent complication limiting the long-term (>1 year) survival after heart transplantation (HTx). CAV is initiated by endothelial dysfunction and can lead to severe cardiovascular (CV) complications. Since CAV is often clinically silent, biomarkers could help identifying HTx patients at risk of CAV and their severe complications. Aim. Evaluate the clinical yield of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), marker of cardiomyocyte damage, and the soluble form of AXL (sAXL), biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, to assess the prognosis of long-term cardiovascular (CV) events occurring after HTx. Methods. 96 patients were evaluated at least > 1 year after HTx. CAV was evaluated by coronary angiography or multisliced tomography, and hs-cTnT and sAXL measured 6 months before or after CAV evaluation. Patients were followed during 42 ± 15 months for a combined end point including cardiac death, angina or acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, or heart failure not due to an acute rejection. Results. 51 patients (53%) presented CAV at evaluation; 21 of them had CV events. Hs-cTnT (56 ± 45 versus 20 ± 18 ng/L; ) and sAXL concentrations (98 ± 51 versus 26 ± 26 ng/L; ) were significantly higher in patients with CV events. Hs-cTnT (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.015–1.042, ) and sAXL (HR 1.01; 95% CI 1.001–1.019, ) were independent predictors of CV events. A hs-cTnT concentration < 21 ng/L, detected by AUC ROC, predicted the absence of CV events with a predictive value of 91%; sAXL did not add more predictive value to hs-cTnT. Survival free of CV events was 92% in patients with hs-cTnT < 21 ng/L and 57% in those with hs-cTnT > 21 ng/L (). Conclusion. Hs-cTnT, but not sAXL, measured during the long-term follow-up of HTx patients appears as a helpful biomarker to identify patients at low risk of adverse CV outcomes.\n",

The present study investigated PCT plasma concentration in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and its prognostic value during 24-month follow-up. Material and Methods. Study group consisted of 130 patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 45%) and 32 controls. PCT level was assessed on admission in all patients. Telephone follow-up was performed every three months over a period of 2 years. Endpoints were death of all causes and readmission for HFrEF exacerbation. Results. HFrEF patients had significantly higher PCT concentration than controls (166.95 versus 22.15 pg/ml; ). Individuals with peripheral oedema had increased PCT comparing to those without oedema (217.07 versus 152.12 pg/ml; ). In ROC analysis, PCT turned out to be a valuable diagnostic marker of HFrEF (AUC 0.91; ). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that patients with PCT in the 4th quartile had significantly lower probability of survival than those with PCT in the 1st and 2nd quartiles. In univariate, but not multivariate, analysis, procalcitonin turned out to be a significant predictor of death during 24-month follow-up. (; 95% CI 1.000–1.003; ). Conclusions. Elevated PCT concentration may serve as another predictor of worse outcome in patients with HFrEF.\n",

We hypothesized that visfatin could be a potential circulating biomarker in critical illness and sepsis. We therefore measured serum levels of visfatin in a cohort of 229 critically ill medical patients upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In comparison to 53 healthy controls, visfatin levels were significantly elevated in medical ICU patients, especially in patients with sepsis. Visfatin serum concentrations were strongly associated with disease severity and organ failure but did not differ between patients with or without obesity or type 2 diabetes. Visfatin levels correlated with biomarkers of renal failure, liver dysfunction, and other adipokines (e.g., resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in critically ill patients. High visfatin levels at ICU admission indicated an increased mortality, both at the ICU and during long-term follow-up of approximately two years. Our data therefore demonstrate that circulating visfatin is a valuable biomarker for risk and prognosis assessment in critically ill patients. Furthermore, visfatin seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of excessive systemic inflammation, supporting further research on visfatin as a therapeutic target.\n",

Numerous studies have examined the diagnostic and prognostic potencies of circulating cardiac biomarkers in acute coronary syndrome/AMI and heart failure after AMI, and even fewer have depicted the utility of biomarkers in AMI patients undergoing primary PCI. Although complete revascularization at early period of acute coronary syndrome/AMI is an established factor for improved short-term and long-term prognosis and lowered risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications, late adverse cardiac remodelling may be a major risk factor for one-year mortality and postponded heart failure manifestation after PCI with subsequent blood flow resolving in culprit coronary artery. The aim of the review was to focus an attention on circulating biomarker as a promising tool to stratify AMI patients at high risk of poor cardiac recovery and developing HF after successful PCI. The main consideration affects biomarkers of inflammation, biomechanical myocardial stress, cardiac injury and necrosis, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular reparation. Clinical utilities and predictive modalities of natriuretic peptides, cardiac troponins, galectin 3, soluble suppressor tumorogenicity-2, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, growth differential factor-15, midregional proadrenomedullin, noncoding RNAs, and other biomarkers for adverse cardiac remodelling are discussed in the review.\n",

Indeed, RASs detected in DAA treatment-naïve HCV-infected patients could be useful for clinical management and outcome prediction. Although the frequency of naturally occurring HCV NS5A and NS5B RASs has been addressed in many countries, there are only a few reports on their prevalence in the South American region. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RASs to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors in a DAA treatment naïve cohort of Uruguayan patients infected with chronic hepatitis C and compare them with reports from other South American countries. Here, we found that naturally occurring substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors were present in 8% and 19.2%, respectively, of treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients. Importantly, the baseline substitutions in NS5A and NS5B herein identified differ from the studies previously reported in Brazil. Furthermore, Uruguayan strains subtype 1a clustered within all major world clades, showing that HCV variants currently circulating in this country are characterized by a remarkable genetic diversity.\n",

            "\n",
            "Human strongyloidiasis a soil-transmitted infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis is one of the most neglected amongst the so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). S. stercoralis is a nematode, which is distributed worldwide; it has been estimated that it could affect millions of people, mainly in tropical and subtropical endemic regions. The difficulties of diagnosis lead to infection rates being underreported. Asymptomatic patients have chronic infections that can lead to severe hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated strongyloidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Strongyloidiasis can easily be misdiagnosed because conventional faecal-based techniques lack of sensitivity for the morphological identification of infective larvae in faeces. None of the currently used molecular methods have used urine samples as an alternative to faecal samples for diagnosing strongyloidiasis. This study was thus aimed at comparing, for the first time, the use of a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) molecular assay (Strong-LAMP) to traditional methods on patients’ urine samples. Twenty-four urine samples were taken from patients included in a study involving two Spanish hospitals for strongyloidiasis screening using parasitological and serological tests. Strongyloides larvae were found in 11 patients’ faecal samples, thereby ascertaining that they had the disease. Other patients had high antibody titres but no larvae were found in their faeces. All urine samples were analysed by PCR and Strong-LAMP assay. No amplification occurred when using PCR. Strong-LAMP led to detecting S. stercoralis DNA in urine samples from patients having previously confirmed strongyloidiasis by parasitological tests and/or a suspicion of being infected by serological ones. The Strong-LAMP assay is a useful molecular tool for research regarding strongyloidiasis in human urine samples. After further validation, the Strong-LAMP assay could also be used for complementary and effective diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in a clinical setting.\n",

In recent years, long noncoding RNA H19 has been reported to affect the proliferation and apoptosis of vascular cells, which directly or indirectly results in atherosclerosis. We performed a case-control study to explore the relationship between H19 gene polymorphisms (rs2735971, rs2839698, and rs3024270) and the risk of CAD. Methods. We collected 732 samples from Liaoning Province, China, and three polymorphisms in long noncoding RNA H19 were genotyped using the KASP platform. Results.

Our study demonstrated that some genotypes of H19 rs2735971 and rs3024270 polymorphisms, as well as rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C haplotype, were associated with the risk of CAD in a Chinese population, and these genotypes have the potential to be biomarkers for predicting CAD risk. We also found that rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C may have a significantly lower risk of CAD. The recessive genetic model of rs3024270 could predict the severity of CAD.\n",

            "\n",
            "Purpose. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lncRNAs are considered to be genetic factors that influence cancer susceptibility. The lncRNA GAS5, MEG3, and PCAT-1 polymorphisms are shown to be possibly associated with cancer risk. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate this association. Methods. Studies were selected from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model or fixed-effects model to assess the association between lncRNA polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility. Metaregression and publication bias analyses were also conducted. All analyses were performed using the Stata 12.0 software. Results. Sixteen articles (covering 13750 cases and 17194 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. A significant association between SNP rs145204276 and gastric cancer risk was observed (del vs. ins: , ; del/del vs. ins/ins+del/ins: , ; del/ins vs. ins/ins: , ). For rs16901904, a decreased cancer risk was observed in three genetic models (C vs. T: , ; CC vs. CT+TT: , ; CC vs. TT: , ). No statistical significance was found in the metaregression analysis. For all of the included SNPs, no publication bias was found in all genotype models. Conclusions. The rs145204276 SNP in lncRNA GAS5 is likely to be associated with gastric cancer risk, whereas the rs16901904 SNP in lncRNA PCAT-1 bears association with a decreased cancer risk.\n"

            "\n",
            "Aim. Increasing evidence indicates that hepatic subcapsular flow (HSF) can serve as a noninvasive ultrasonographic marker for the early diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA). However, results regarding its diagnostic accuracy are inconsistent and inconclusive. We conducted this meta-analysis with an aim to systematically evaluate the diagnostic value of HSF in predicting BA. Methods. A comprehensive literature search of four databases was conducted to identify the eligible studies. All analyses were performed using STATA 12.0. Results. Nine studies from eight articles containing 368 patients and 469 controls were included in our meta-analysis. Briefly, the values for pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.95 (95% CI 0.88-0.98), 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.96), 11.6 (95% CI 6.3-21.5), 0.06 (95% CI 0.02-0.14), 201 (95% CI 59-689), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), respectively. Additionally, metaregression along with subgroup analysis based on various covariates revealed the potential sources of heterogeneity and the detailed diagnostic value in each subgroup. Conclusion. Our meta-analysis showed that HSF assay could provide high accuracy in predicting BA patients and non-BA individuals. However, further studies with better design and larger sample size are required to support the results of the present study.\n"

              "['Progression of Aortic Arch Calcification Is Associated with Overall and Cardiovascular Mortality in Hemodialysis\\n\\nBackground. Vascular calcification is common and associated with unfavorable outcomes among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Nevertheless, little is known whether the progression of vascular calcification outweighs the baseline calcification in association with overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods. This study included 140 maintenance HD patients. Vascular calcification was assessed using the aortic arch calcification (AoAC) score measured from chest radiographs at the baseline and the second year of follow-up. Progression of vascular calcification (ΔAoAC) was defined as the difference between the two measurements of AoAC. The association of ΔAoAC with overall and CV mortality was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results. During the mean follow-up period of 5.8 years, there were 49 (35%) overall mortality and 27 (19.3%) CV mortality. High brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was positively correlated with ΔAoAC, whereas old age was negatively correlated with ΔAoAC. In multivariate adjusted Cox analysis, increased ΔAoAC (per 1 unit), but not baseline AoAC, was significantly associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.183; 95% CI, 1.056–1.327; ) and CV mortality (HR, 1.194; 95% CI, 1.019–1.398; ). Conclusion. Progression of AoAC outperformed the baseline AoAC in association with increased risk of overall and CV mortality in HD patients. A regular follow-up of chest radiograph and AoAC score assessments are simple and cost-effective to identify the high-risk individuals of unfavorable outcomes in maintenance HD patients.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'A Trypanosoma cruzi Genome Tandem Repetitive Satellite DNA Sequence as a Molecular Marker for a LAMP Assay for Diagnosing Chagas’ Disease\\n\\nChagas’ disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi which is endemic throughout Latin America and is spread by worldwide migration. Diagnosis is currently limited to serological and molecular techniques having variations regarding their sensitivity and specificity. This work was aimed at developing a new sensitive, applicable, and cost-effective molecular diagnosis technique for loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based detection of T. cruzi (Tc-LAMP). The results led to determining a highly homologous satellite repeat region (231\\u2009bp) among parasite strains as a molecular marker for diagnosing the disease. Tc-LAMP was performed correctly for detecting parasite DNA (5\\u2009fg for the CL Brener strain and 50\\u2009fg for the DM28, TcVI, and TcI strains). Assay results proved negative for DNA from 16 helminth species and 7 protozoa, including Leishmania spp. Tc-LAMP based on the highly repeated T. cruzi satellite region is thus proposed as an important alternative for diagnosing T. cruzi infection, overcoming other methods’ limitations such as their analytic capability, speed, and requiring specialized equipment or highly trained personnel. Tc-LAMP could be easily adapted for point-of-care testing in areas having limited resources.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Assessing the Prognostic Performance of the Child-Pugh, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, and Albumin-Bilirubin Scores in Patients with Decompensated Cirrhosis: A Large Asian Cohort from Gastroenterology Department\\n\\nBackground and Aim. Various methods, including the Child-Pugh score, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, the MELD combined with serum sodium concentration (MELD-Na) score, the integrated MELD (iMELD) score, and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, have been widely used for predicting the survival of decompensated cirrhosis (DeCi) patients. In this study, we defined and compared the prognostic value of these scores to predict mortality in DeCi patients. Methods. We performed a single-center, observational retrospective study and analyzed 456 DeCi patients who were hospitalized in the gastroenterology department. The biochemical examination results and demographic characteristics of the patients were obtained, and five scores were calculated upon admission after 24 hours. All patients were observed until death, loss to follow-up, or specific follow-up times (28 days, 90 days, and 6 months). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the ability of these methods to predict mortality in DeCi patients. Results. At 28 days, 90 days, and 6 months, the cumulative number of deaths was 50 (11.0%), 76 (16.6%), and 91 (19.9%), respectively. The scores were significantly higher in nonsurviving patients than in surviving patients. All scores yielded viable values in predicting 28-day, 90-day, and 6-month prognoses for DeCi patients. The areas under the ROC curve (AUROCs) of the ALBI score were higher than those of the other scores, which were only over 0.700 at 28 days. The AUROC of the MELD score was higher than that of the other scores, including the MELD-Na and iMELD scores, at 90 days and 6 months. Conclusion. All five methods (Child-Pugh score, MELD score, MELD-Na score, iMELD score, and ALBI score) provided a reliable prediction of mortality for both the short-term and long-term prognosis of patients with DeCi. The ALBI score may be particularly useful for assessing short-term outcomes, whereas the MELD score may be particularly useful for assessing long-term outcomes.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The aim of our study was to evaluate plasma and urinary levels of GDF-15 after pediatric renal transplantation (Rtx) and in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its associations to cardiovascular risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, GDF-15 was measured in plasma and urine from 53 children with a renal transplant and 83 children with CKD and related to cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, obesity, and cholesterol) and kidney function. Forty healthy children served as a control group. Plasma levels of GDF-15 (median and range) for a Tx (transplantation) cohort, CKD cohort, and healthy controls were, respectively, 865\\u2009ng/L (463-3039\\u2009ng/L), 508\\u2009ng/L (183-3279\\u2009ng/L), and 390\\u2009ng/L (306-657\\u2009ng/L). The CKD and Tx cohorts both had significantly higher GDF-15 levels than the control group (). Univariate associations between GDF-15 and hyperuricemia (), elevated triglycerides (), low HDL (), and obesity () were found. However, mGFR () and hemoglobin () were the only significant predictors of GDF-15 in an adjusted analysis. Urinary GDF-15/creatinine ratios were 448\\u2009ng/mmol (74–5013\\u2009ng/mmol) and 540\\u2009ng/mmol (5–14960\\u2009ng/mmol) in the Tx cohort and CKD cohort, respectively. In the CKD cohort, it was weakly correlated to mGFR (, ). Plasma levels of GDF-15 are elevated in children with CKD and after Rtx. The levels were not associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors but strongly associated with renal function.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-term prognosis value of sST2 for an unfavorable outcome in hypertensive patients. Methods. This was a prospective observational study which enrolled 80 patients with hypertension, who were followed for one year. All patients underwent clinical, laboratory (including sST2), and echocardiographic assessment at baseline. The patients were grouped according to the cardiovascular (CV) events reported during the follow-up: group A (with CV events) and group B (without CV events). Results. Overall, 59 CV events were reported during the follow-up period. Compared to group B, the patients in group A had significantly higher sST2 levels, a higher number of CV risk factors, and a higher left ventricle mass. Except for the diastolic dysfunction parameters, the echocardiographic findings were similar in the two groups. Patients in group A had a lower  ratio, larger deceleration time, and increased telediastolic pressure as quantified by the  ratio than those in group B. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sST2 and fasting plasma glucose at baseline were independent predictors for the CV events reported during the follow-up period.  were associated with poor clinical outcomes (, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Conclusions. sST2 levels were correlated with the risk of adverse CV outcomes in hypertensive patients and may represent a useful prognostic marker in these patients.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Functional Characterization of a Missense Variant of MLH1 Identified in Lynch Syndrome Pedigree\\n\\nLynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRCs) inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. Here, we reported a multigeneration Chinese family clinically diagnosed with LS according to the Amsterdam II criteria. To identify the underlying causative gene for LS in this family, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed. A germline missense variant (c.2054C>T:p.S685F) in exon 18 of MLH1 was successfully identified by WES. Sanger sequencing verified the results of WES and also confirmed the cosegregation of the MLH1 missense variant in all affected members of the family including two unaffected family members. Bioinformatic tools predicted the identified MLH1 variant as deleterious. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed loss of MLH1 and PMS2 protein expression. In vitro expression analysis also revealed that the identified MLH1 missense variant (c.2054C>T:p.S685F) results in reduced expression of both MLH1 and PMS2 proteins. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the missense mutation c.2054C>T in MLH1 was classified as a “pathogenic” variant. Two unaffected family members were later recommended for colonoscopy and other important cancer diagnostic inspections every 1-2 years as both were at higher risk of LS. In conclusion, our findings widen the genotypic spectrum of MLH1 mutations responsible for LS. This study increases the phenotypic spectrum of LS which will certainly help the clinicians in diagnosing LS in multigeneration families. This study also puts emphasis on the importance of genetic counselling for the benefit of asymptomatic carriers of MMR gene variants who are at higher risk of LS.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'New Insights into the Role of Tyro3, Axl, and Mer Receptors in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\n\\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease involving joints. Among several pathogenic mechanisms, the impairment of homeostatic regulators of inflammation seems to be critically important to sustain persistent infiltration and activation of immune and stromal cells within the diseased synovium. Tyrosine kinase receptors Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are members of the TAM family. Upon binding their ligands Growth Arrest-Specific gene 6 (Gas6) and Protein S (ProS1), TAM receptors (TAMs) exert numerous and diverse biologic functions. Activated Axl and Mer, for instance, can negatively regulate the inflammatory cascade and mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, contributing to prevent the development of autoimmunity. Thus, a role for TAMs has been hypothesized in RA. In this review, we will summarise unmet clinical needs in RA, depict the biology of TAMs and TAM ligands, focussing on their ability to regulate the immune system and inflammation cascade, and finally offer an overview of the state-of-the-art literature about the putative role of TAM axis in RA.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of death of women due to cancer in the United States. Although carbohydrate antigen 125 has a moderate diagnostic utility, the phenomenon of false-positive exists. As novel effective biomarkers, some single microRNAs (miRNAs) have diagnostic values for ovarian cancer, but the results lack consistency. In order to precisely and comprehensively assess the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer, a meta-analysis is performed. Methods. Articles concerning the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer were searched from databases. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Area under curve (AUC) of the summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curve was also calculated. Results. In total, 22 studies including 8 kinds of single miRNAs were enrolled in this paper (6 studies for miR-200c, 3 studies for miR-200a and miR-200b, and 2 studies for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b). For miR-200c, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.768 (95% CI: 0.722-0.811) and 0.680 (95% CI: 0.624-0.732); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 2.897 (95% CI: 1.787-4.698) and 0.340 (95% CI: 0.276-0.417); the pooled DOR was 8.917 (95% CI: 4.521-17.587); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.815. For miR-200a, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.759 (95% CI: 0.670-0.833) and 0.717 (95% CI: 0.627-0.795); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 3.129 (95% CI: 0.997-9.816) and 0.301 (95% CI: 0.207-0.437); the pooled DOR was 11.323 (95% CI: 3.493-36.711); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.857. For miR-200b, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.853 (95% CI: 0.776-0.912) and 0.775 (95% CI: 0.690-0.846); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 4.327 (95% CI: 0.683-27.415) and 0.225 (95% CI: 0.081-0.625); the pooled DOR was 19.678 (95% CI: 2.812-137.72); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.90. For miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b, each diagnostic value should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies were included. Conclusions. miR-200c, miR-200a, and miR-200b can be useful diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer.

Laboratory markers which can help in identifying PE patients from pregnant women and assessing the severity of PE during pregnancy are worthy to be explored. In this study, a retrospective case-control study was designed to assess whether the serum levels of albumin (ALB), total protein (TP), prealbumin (PA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, fibrinogen (Fbg), platelet (PLT) count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width (PDW) can help in assessing PE and evaluate its severity. 256 pregnant women were enrolled and classified into 3 groups: mild preeclampsia (mPE, ), severe preeclampsia (sPE, ), and healthy normotensive controls (control, ). Our result showed that the serum levels of ALP, LDH, and D-dimer were significantly higher in mild or severe PE patients compared with the healthy controls (66 (52.5-76.5) vs. 168 (141.5-201.25) vs. 182.5 (120-191.5), 152 (139.75-166.25) vs. 183.5 (163.25-307) vs. 282 (215.25-306), 1.05 (0.65-1.57) vs. 3.05 (2.25-4.08) vs. 5.65 (2.29-7.71)), while ALB, TP, and PA are lower (38 (37-42) vs. 31.5 (25.5-34.5) vs. 28.5 (24-33), 65 (63-68.25) vs. 56.5 (52-61) vs. 51.5 (49-58),  vs.  vs. ). On the other hand, compared with the mPE group, the sPE group showed significantly lower PLT count but higher level of LDH, D-dimer, and Fbg. No significant differences in MPV or PDW were found between any of the two groups. In conclusion, the above markers except for the MPV and PDW may be correlated with PE severity in this patient cohort, indicating possible values of these potential biomarkers in auxiliary diagnosis and severity assessment of PE.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Fatty acid synthase (FASN) has been regarded as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we evaluated FASN expression at both mRNA and protein levels and assessed the association between FASN expression and prognosis in male Han Chinese with PCa treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods. Expression profile and prognostic value of FASN were analyzed in tissue microarray (TMA) and data retrieved from databases including TCGA public database, GEO database, and our sequencing data with whole clinicopathological characteristics. Results. FASN expression was associated with clinical parameters and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. The relative expression of FASN mRNA was higher in the tumor tissue in all public databases and our sequencing data (). A similar result was seen in tissue microarray (TMA) (). Analysis of our sequencing data indicated that FASN’s relative expression was associated with tumor stage (), and FASN expression was positively associated with the Gleason score () and seminal vesicle invasion () in TMA. We found that high FASN expression was an independent predictor of shorter BCR-free survival with univariate and multivariate survival analysis (), rendering FASN an optimal prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with prostate cancer. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that FASN was overexpressed at mRNA and protein levels in PCa. We found that patients with high FASN expression had a shorter BCR-free survival, showing its value as a prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with PCa.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Diet Alters Serum Metabolomic Profiling in the Mouse Model of Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy\\n\\nChagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi which is endemic in Latin America. T. cruzi infection results in a latent infection with approximately a third of latently infected patients developing chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM). CCM is a common cause of cardiomyopathy in endemic regions and has a poor prognosis compared to other cardiomyopathies. The factors responsible for the transition from the asymptomatic indeterminate latent stage of infection to CCM are poorly understood. Our previous studies demonstrated that lipid metabolism and diet are important determinants of disease progression. In the present study, we analyzed various serum metabolomic biomarkers such as acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids in murine models of CCM, where the mice specifically develop either left or right ventricular cardiomyopathy based on the diets fed during the indeterminate stage in a murine model of Chagas disease. Our data provide new insights into the metabolic changes that may predispose patients to CCM and biomarkers that may help predict the risk of developing cardiomyopathy from T. cruzi infection. Author Summary. Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) is a parasitic disease prevalent in Latin America. Currently, no effective drugs or vaccines are available to prevent or cure CCM. The factors involved in the disease severity and progression are poorly understood to design new therapeutic interventions. In order to rapidly identify Chagas patients with a higher risk to develop CCM, a new set of biomarkers specific to Chagas disease is needed. We performed serum metabolomic analyses in chronic T. cruzi-infected mice fed on different diets and identified cardiac ventricular-specific metabolite biomarkers that could define CCM severity. In this paper, we present the results of serum metabolomic analyses and discuss its correlations to the diet-induced metabolic regulations in the pathogenesis of CCM in a murine model of Chagas disease.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

However, the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels and relevance of coronary artery disease (CAD) remain largely unknown. This study is aimed at examining the relationship between the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels and the severity of coronary stenosis in patients with CAD. In the present study, the expression of ADAMTS-5 was analyzed in coronary artery samples and blood. The results showed that the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels were lower in the CAD group than in the control group. In addition, significantly higher matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 2 and MMP-9 levels were also observed in the patients with CAD, and the ADAMTS-5 levels were negatively correlated with the MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the Gensini score was negatively correlated with the ADAMTS-5 levels but was positively correlated with the MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that ADAMTS-5, MMP-2, and MMP-9 may have a certain diagnostic value in CAD and that the combination of all three metalloproteinases had a higher diagnostic value. The findings provided a better understanding of the role of ADAMTS-5 in the diagnosis of CAD.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

We performed a post hoc analysis of patients, enrolled in 2 prospective trials investigating the clinical effects of CD34+ cell therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). CD34+ cells were mobilized by G-CSF, collected via apheresis, and injected transendocardially using NOGA system. Patients were followed for 3 months and demographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical parameters and gal-3 were analyzed at baseline and at follow-up. Response to cell therapy was defined as an LVEF increase of ≥5%. Results. 61 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 52 years and 83% were male. DCMP and ICMP were present in 69% and 31% of patients, respectively. The average serum creatinine was  μmol/L, NT-proBNP 1132 (IQR 350-2279) pg/mL, and LVEF %. Gal-3 at baseline and at 3 months did not differ significantly ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ), and there were no differences in baseline gal-3 with respect to heart failure etiology ( ng/mL in ICMP vs.  ng/mL in DCMP; ). Comparing responders () to nonresponders (), we found no differences in baseline gal-3 ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ). However, responders had significantly lower gal-3 at 3-month follow-up ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ). Also, responders demonstrated a significant decrease in gal-3 over 3 months, while in nonresponders, an increase in gal-3 occurred ( ng/mL vs. ng/mL; ). Conclusions. In patients with chronic heart failure undergoing CD34+ cell therapy, a decrease in galectin-3 plasma levels is associated with beneficial response to this treatment modality. Further prospective data is warranted to confirm our findings and to deepen our understanding of the role of gal-3 in the field of stem cell therapy.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Circulating MicroRNAs as Novel Potential Biomarkers for Left Ventricular Remodeling in Postinfarction Heart Failure\\n\\nCirculating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as potential biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling in postinfarction heart failure (HF). However, the diagnostic reproducibility of the use of circulating miRNAs may be affected by the temporal expression of miRNAs following myocardial infarction (MI). In the current study, using a MI-induced HF rat cohort (4-, 8-, and 12-week post-MI groups), we investigated the temporal expression of plasma miRNAs during the development of left ventricular remodeling. The plasma miRNA expression profile was obtained using miRNA sequencing. The expression of candidate miRNAs in plasma and tissues was examined with real-time PCR. Target genes of candidate miRNAs were predicted using a parallel miRNA-messenger RNA expression profiling approach. The value of plasma miRNAs as biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling was evaluated in patients with postinfarction HF () and control patients with stable angina and without significant coronary lesions and HF () with real-time PCR. Although the expression levels of miR-20a-5p, miR-340-5p, and let-7i-5p were temporally regulated in plasma, myocardium, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression levels of plasma miRNAs, especially miR-20a-5p, were associated with the development of left ventricular remodeling in the postinfarction HF rat cohort. The target genes of these 3 miRNAs were associated with the mechanistic target of rapamycin, nuclear factor-κB, tumour necrosis factor, apoptosis, and p53 signaling pathways. Additionally, the plasma levels of miR-20a-5p, miR-340-5p, and let-7i-5p were significantly increased in patients with postinfarction HF. However, only the expression levels of miR-20a-5p presented significant positive correlations with left ventricular internal end diastolic dimension and left ventricular end diastolic volume. In conclusion, the expression levels of plasma miR-20a-5p were significantly associated with the degree of left ventricular dilatation, and plasma miR-20a-5p may be a potential biomarker for postinfarction left ventricular remodeling.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Cardiac Chagas Disease: MMPs, TIMPs, Galectins, and TGF-β as Tissue Remodelling Players\\n\\nA century after the discovery of Chagas disease, studies are still needed to establish the complex pathophysiology of this disease. However, it is known that several proteins and molecules are related to the establishment of this disease, its evolution, and the appearance of its different clinical forms. Metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, galectins, and TGF-β are involved in the process of infection and consequently the development of myocarditis, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis upon infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. Thus, considering that the heart is one of the main target organs in Chagas disease, knowledge regarding the mechanisms of action of these molecules is essential to understand how they interact and trigger local and systemic reactions and, consequently, determine whether they contribute to the development of Chagas’ heart disease. In this sense, it is believed that the inflammatory microenvironment caused by the infection alters the expression of these proteins favoring progression of the host-parasite cycle and thereby stimulating cardiac tissue remodeling mechanisms and fibrosis. The aim of this review was to gather information on metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, galectins, and TGF-β and discuss how these molecules and their different interrelationships contribute to the development of Chagas’ heart disease.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'The Crucial Role of CXCL8 and Its Receptors in Colorectal Liver Metastasis\\n\\nCXCL8 (also known as IL-8) can produce different biological effects by binding to its receptors: CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). CXCL8 and its receptors are associated with the development of various tumor types, especially colorectal cancer and its liver metastases. In addition to promoting angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, migration, and the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, CXCL8 and its receptors have also been known to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells, to help them to escape host immunosurveillance as well as to enhance resistance to anoikis, which promotes the formation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and their colonization of distant organs. In this paper, we will review the established roles of CXCL8 signaling in CRC and discuss the possible strategies of targeting CXCL8 signaling for overcoming CRC drug resistance and cancer progression, including direct targeting of CXCL8/CXCR1/2 or indirect targeting through the inhibition of CXCL8-CXCR1/2 signaling.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Urinary Matrix Metalloproteinase-7 and Prediction of AKI Progression Post Cardiac Surgery\\n\\nAims. Early detection of patients at high risk for progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery remains a major challenge. We aim to evaluate the utility of urinary matrix metalloproteinase-7 (uMMP-7) and other reported biomarkers for predicting AKI progression during postoperative hospital stay. Methods. We conducted a prospective, multicenter cohort study in 121 adult patients with stage 1 or 2 AKI after cardiac surgery. uMMP-7 and other well-reported biomarkers (uIL-18, uNGAL, and UACR) were measured at time of AKI clinical diagnosis. The primary outcome is the progression of AKI after cardiac surgery, defined as worsening of AKI stage (stage 1 to either stage 2 or stage 3 or from stage 2 to stage 3). Results. A level of  at time of AKI diagnosis conveyed an 8-fold risk of AKI progression as compared to those with  after adjusting for clinical risk factors. The performance of uMMP-7 for predicting progressive AKI was good with an AUC of 0.80. The combination of uMMP-7 and IL-18 produces the greatest AUC for predicting progressive AKI. Addition of uMMP-7 to the clinical risk factor model significantly improved risk reclassification for AKI progression. Conclusions. uMMP-7, measured at time of AKI clinical diagnosis, is a novel biomarker for predicting the progression of AKI after cardiac surgery. Adding uMMP-7 to the clinical risk factor model may be used as a noninvasive approach to identify a subpopulation that is at high risk for progressive AKI after cardiac surgery.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Pregnancy with Intrauterine Growth Restriction: A Pilot Study\\n\\nObjective. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a major cause of late stillbirth, though not all compromised babies remain small or are considered growth restricted as pregnancy progresses. Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (f-MRI) represents a second-line tool to study pregnancies with IUGR fetuses. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of f-MRI on predicting fetal growth and the offspring’s perinatal respiratory outcome. Design. All f-MRI performed between 2014 and 2016 in Siena were analysed. Pregnancies with IUGR (Study group (SG)) were recruited together with a control population (Control group (CG)), coupled for gestational age (GA) at the time of f-MRI (mean GA 31 wks). Neonatal information was collected. The f-MRI protocol consisted of T2w images. Six regions of interest (ROI) were placed as follows: 2 on the lung, 2 on the liver, and 2 on the amniotic fluid. The signal intensities (SI) of each ROI were measured. The SI lung to liver ratio (SI lung/liver) and SI lung to amniotic fluid ratio (SI lung/amniotic fluid) were obtained for each fetus. Each ratio was compared between SG and CG. Therefore, SG was divided into two subgroups: adequate and small for gestational age (AGA and SGA) newborns. All measurements were related to offspring’s perinatal respiratory outcome. Results. SI lung/liver was linearly related with GA at the time of f-MRI and with EFW. SI lung/amniotic fluid was significantly higher in SG than in CG (). In contrast, among SG, lower values of SI lung/amniotic fluid were found in the SGA compared to AGA (). The days of oxygen supply were higher in the SGA subgroup than in the AGA subgroup (). Conclusions. SI lung/liver increases with fetal lung maturation and appears to be useful to estimate intrauterine fetal growth. SI lung/amniotic fluid seems to be a reliable predictive index to distinguish the IUGR fetuses that can recover their growth from those that were born SGA. f-MRI represents a promising frontier to predict IUGR fetus outcome, thus contributing to ameliorate the perinatal management.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Prognostic Value of MicroRNAs in Patients after Myocardial Infarction: A Substudy of PRAGUE-18\\n\\nBackground. The evaluation of the long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an established clinical process. Laboratory markers may significantly help with the risk stratification of these patients. Our objective was to find the relation of selected microRNAs to the standard markers of AMI and determine if these microRNAs can be used to identify patients at increased risk. Methods. Selected microRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499) were measured in a cohort of 122 patients from the PRAGUE-18 study (ticagrelor vs. prasugrel in AMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI)). The cohort was split into two subgroups: 116 patients who did not die (survivors) and 6 patients who died (nonsurvivors) during the 365-day period after AMI. Plasma levels of selected circulating miRNAs were then assessed in combination with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Results. miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 correlated positively with NT-proBNP and hsTnT 24 hours after admission and negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Both miR-1 and miR-133a positively correlated with hsTnT at admission. Median relative levels of all selected miRNAs were higher in the subgroup of nonsurvivors () in comparison with survivors (), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. All patients in the nonsurvivor subgroup had miR-499 and NT-proBNP levels above the cut-off values (891.5\\u2009ng/L for NT-proBNP and 0.088 for miR-499), whereas in the survivor subgroup, only 28.4% of patients were above the cut-off values (). Conclusions. Statistically significant correlation was found between miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 and hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and LVEF. In addition, this analysis suggests that plasma levels of circulating miR-499 could contribute to the identification of patients at increased risk of death during the first year after AMI, especially when combined with NT-proBNP levels.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Long Noncoding RNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, SMILR, and MALAT1 in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Validation of Biomarkers in Clinical Samples\\n\\nBackground and Objectives. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a silent disease characterised by aortic wall expansion and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dedifferentiation from contractile to synthetic phenotype. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in VSMC phenotypic regulation could be considered as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets of TAA. In vitro studies show that lncRNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, MALAT1, and SMILR are associated with the VSMC phenotypic state. Our aim was to test if these lncRNAs are dysregulated during TAA formation in clinical patient samples. Materials and Methods. Relative expression of lncRNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, SMILR, and MALAT1 was tested in clinical aortic tissue and blood plasma samples from TAA and non-TAA patients using the qRT-PCR method. The Mann–Whitney  test was used to compare ΔCt values between the study groups. ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of plasma lncRNAs. Results. We found significantly reduced CARMN () and LUCAT1 () expression in aortic tissue samples from TAA patients. Relative expression of MALAT1 () and SMILR () did not differ in aortic tissue between the TAA and non-TAA groups. Expression of both LUCAT1 and SMILR was significantly decreased in TAA patients’ blood plasma compared to controls ( and , respectively). However, only LUCAT1 showed the ability to discriminate aneurysmal disease in patients’ blood plasma (, , ). Conclusions. We have shown that the expression of lncRNAs CARMN and LUCAT1 is reduced in dilated aortic tissue and that the LUCAT1 and SMILR expression is lower in the blood plasma of TAA patients. Decreased LUCAT1 expression in TAA patients’ blood plasma may have diagnostic potential in discriminating patients with TAA.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Association of Plasma Renalase and Left Ventricle Mass Index in Heart Failure Patients Stratified to the Category of the Ejection Fraction: A Pilot Study\\n\\nHeart failure represents a growing health problem, with increasing morbidity and mortality globally. According to the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure, many biomarkers have been proposed for the timely diagnosis and prognostication of patients with heart failure, but other than natriuretic peptides, none of them has gained enough clinical significance. Renalase, a new protein derived from kidneys was demonstrated to metabolize catecholamines and to have a cardioprotective role. The aim of the study was to determine whether renalase and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration could be used to differentiate heart failure patients stratified to the category of the ejection fraction and whether plasma renalase could be used as a biomarker for left ventricle hypertrophy in all subgroups of heart failure patients. We included patients diagnosed with heart failure and stratified them to the three subgroups according to the ejection fraction. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, HFmrEF had an intermediate profile in between HFrEF and HFpEF, with statistical significance in most evaluated parameters. BNP concentration was significantly different in all three subgroups (), and renalase was statistically higher in HFrEF () compared to the HFmrEF and HFpEF, where its results were similar, without statistical significance. Renalase plasma concentration was demonstrated to be highly and positively associated with left ventricle mass index in HFrEF (), as well as increased plasma concentration of BNP (). In the HFmrEF group of patients, body mass index was positively associated with LVMI (), while in the patients with HFpEF, diabetes mellitus was demonstrated to have a positive association with LVMI (). These findings suggest that renalase concentration may be measured in order to differentiate patients with reduced ejection fraction. Plasma renalase concentrations positively correlated with left ventricle hypertrophy in patients with reduced ejection fraction, being strongly associated with increased left ventricular mass index.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Vitamin D Deficiency Predicts Poor Clinical Outcomes in Heart Failure Patients Undergoing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy\\n\\nBackground and Aims. Resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves mortality and induces reverse remodeling in heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction and wide QRS. Nonetheless, some patients do not improve despite the optimal medical therapy and right indications for device implantation. Therefore, finding biomarkers suitable for identification of those patients is crucial. Vitamin D plays a classic hormonal role in the regulation of bone metabolism and also has physiological functions in wide range of nonskeletal tissues. Based on recent studies, low levels of vitamin D seem to directly contribute to pathogenesis and worsening of HF. We planned to assess the role of vitamin D levels on clinical outcomes of HF patients undergoing CRT. Methods and Results. We enrolled 136 HF patients undergoing CRT. Total plasma vitamin D levels were measured at baseline and 6 months later. Primary endpoint was 5-year all-cause mortality; secondary endpoint was lack of good clinical response, defined as less than 15% increase of left ventricular ejection fraction after six months. During follow-up, 58 patients reached the primary, and 45 patients reached the secondary endpoint. Vitamin D levels less than 24.13\\u2009ng/mL predicted 5-year mortality () and poor clinical response () after adjusting to all significant baseline predictors. Conclusion. Our study showed that vitamin D deficiency has a significant impact in heart failure patients; it is an independent predictor of lack of midterm clinical response and long-term mortality in patients undergoing CRT. Therefore, monitoring vitamin D status of heart failure patients could be of clinical significance.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Association of Galectin-3 and Soluble ST2, and Their Changes, with Echocardiographic Parameters and Development of Heart Failure after ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction\\n\\nPurpose. To investigate the association of galectin-3 (Gal-3) and soluble ST2 (sST2) and their follow-up changes with the development of heart failure (HF) and echocardiographic parameters of HF (ejection fraction, atrial and ventricular size, left ventricular hypertrophy, e, and E/e) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). Methods. A prospective, observational study, BIOSTRAT (Biomarkers for Risk Stratification After STEMI), enrolled 117 patients between October 2014 and April 2017. Gal-3 and sST2 serum collection and echocardiography were performed twice (during index hospitalization and on a control visit at one-year follow-up). The primary endpoint was HF onset at one-year follow-up. Secondary assessments included associations of biomarker concentration with echocardiographic indices of systolic and diastolic dysfunction at baseline and at one year. Results. Mean baseline concentrations of Gal-3 and sST2 (7.5 and 26.4\\u2009ng/mL, respectively) were significantly increased at one-year follow-up (8.5\\u2009ng/mL and  and 31.4\\u2009ng/mL and , respectively). Patients who reached the primary endpoint (50 patients (48%)) had significantly higher baseline concentrations of both biomarkers and a higher Gal-3 level at one year compared to patients who did not. Both Gal-3 and sST2 were predictors of the primary endpoint in univariate logistic regression analysis, but only Gal-3 remained significant in multivariate analysis. There was no clear association between both biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters. Conclusions. Baseline, but not one-year, changes of Gal-3 and sST2 concentrations may be useful for risk stratification after STEMI. However, only Gal-3 was the independent predictor of HF development at one-year observation. This trial is registered with NCT03735719.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Inflammation-Related Patterns in the Clinical Staging and Severity Assessment of Chronic Kidney Disease\\n\\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) is an irreversible loss of kidney function, and it represents a major global public health burden due to both its prevalence and its continuously increasing incidence. Mineral bone disorders (MBDs) constitute a hallmark of CKD, and alongside cardiovascular complications, they underlie a poor prognosis for these patients. Thus, our study focused on novel CKD biomarker patterns and their impact on the clinical staging of the disease. As a first testing approach, the relative expression levels of 105 proteins were assessed by the Proteome Profiler Cytokine Array Kit for pooled CKD stage 2–4 serum samples to establish an overall view regarding the proteins involved in CKD pathogenesis. Among the molecules that displayed significant dysregulation in the CKD stages, we further explored the involvement of Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk-1), a recognised inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway, and its crosstalk with 1,25OH2D3 (calcitriol) as new players in renal bone and vascular disease. The serum levels of these two molecules were quantified by an ELISA (76 samples), and the results reveal decreasing circulating levels of Dkk-1 and calcitriol in advanced CKD stages, with their circulating expression showing a downward trend as the CKD develops. In the next step, we analysed the inflammation and MBD biomarkers’ expression in CKD (by xMAP array). Our results show that the molecules involved in orchestrating the inflammatory response, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), as well as the mineral biomarkers osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OPN), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), correlate with Dkk-1 and calcitriol, raising the possibility of them being potential useful CKD biomarkers. These results reveal the impact of different biomarker patterns in CKD staging and severity, thus opening up novel approaches to be explored in CKD clinical management.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Gas6/TAM Signaling Components as Novel Biomarkers of Liver Fibrosis\\n\\nLiver fibrosis consists in the accumulation of extracellular matrix components mainly derived from activated hepatic stellate cells. This is commonly the result of chronic liver injury repair and represents an important health concern. As liver biopsy is burdened with many drawbacks, not surprisingly there is great interest to find new reliable noninvasive methods. Among the many are new potential fibrosis biomarkers under study, some of the most promising represented by the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) serum protein and its family of tyrosine kinase receptors, namely, Tyro3, Axl, and MERTK (TAM). Gas6/TAM system (mainly, Axl and MERTK) has in fact recently emerged as an important player in the progression of liver fibrosis. This review is aimed at giving an overall perspective of the roles played by these molecules in major chronic liver diseases. The most promising findings up to date acknowledge that both Gas6 and its receptor serum levels (such as sAxl and, probably, sMERTK) have been shown to potentially allow for easy and accurate measurement of hepatic fibrosis progression, also providing indicative parameters of hepatic dysfunction. Although most of the current scientific evidence is still preliminary and there are no in vivo validation studies on large patient series, it still looks very promising to imagine a possible future prognostic role for these biomarkers in the multidimensional assessment of a liver patient. One may also speculate on a potential role for this system targeting (e.g., with small molecule inhibitors against Axl) as a therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis management, always bearing in mind that any such therapeutic approach might face toxicity.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Ratio of Early Mitral Inflow Velocity to the Global Diastolic Strain Rate and Global Left Ventricular Longitudinal Systolic Strain Predict Overall Mortality and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Hemodialysis Patients\\n\\nBackground. The ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to the global diastolic strain rate (E/E’sr) and global longitudinal systolic strain (GLS) of the left ventricle (LV) are emerging indices of diastolic and systolic functions, respectively, for the LV. Their prognostic significance in the prediction of mortality and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes remains underexplored in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods. This prospective study included 190 maintenance HD patients. The E/E’sr ratio and GLS were assessed using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. The clinical outcomes included overall mortality, CV mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The associations between the E/E’sr ratio, GLS, and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The incremental values of the E/E’sr ratio and GLS in outcome prediction were assessed by  changes in Cox models. Results. Over a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, there were 35 overall deaths, 16 CV deaths, and 45 MACE. Impaired diastolic function with a higher E/E’sr ratio was associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.484; 95% CI, 1.201−1.834; ), CV mortality (HR, 1.584; 95% CI, 1.058–2.371; ), and MACE (HR, 1.205; 95% CI, 1.040−1.397; ) in multivariate adjusted Cox analysis. Worsening GLS was associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.276; 95% CI, 1.101−1.480; ), CV mortality (HR, 1.513; 95% CI, 1.088−2.104; ), and MACE (HR, 1.214; 95% CI, 1.103−1.337; ). The E/E’sr ratio and GLS had better outcome prediction than the E to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/E’) ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Moreover, adding the E/E’sr ratio and GLS to Cox models containing relevant clinical and conventional echocardiographic parameters improved the prediction of overall mortality (), CV mortality (), and MACE (). Conclusion. The E/E’sr ratio and GLS, as emerging indices of LV diastolic and systolic functions, significantly predict mortality and CV outcomes and outperform conventional echocardiographic parameters in outcome prediction in HD patients.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

This study is aimed at determining whether bone mineral density (BMD) values are related to atherogenic indexes (AIs) and could predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in southern Taiwanese adults. Methods. Medical records of 3249 adults who underwent health examinations between June 2014 and February 2018 at a regional hospital in southern Taiwan were reviewed. Data collected included health history, anthropomorphic characteristics, exercise habits, diets (vegetarian or nonvegetarian), clinical laboratory results (lipid profile, systemic blood pressure (SBP), glucose level, creatinine (Cre) level, and hemoglobin (Hb) level), and bone mineral density (BMD), which were used to identify the associations of these parameters, especially BMD, with lipid profile and calculated AIs through simple and multiple linear regressions. Results. The mean age of the patients was 58.0 years, and 71.4% were male. Body mass index (BMI), SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, and all BMD values were positively correlated with triglyceride (TG) level and AIs and were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. The significant positive correlations of BMD at all the measured sites with AIs remained after adjusting for age, sex, SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, smoking, exercise habits, and vegetarian state. The expanded adjusting model for TG/HDL-C remained significant at all the BMD measured sites in nonobese men, at bilateral femoral neck and total hips in nonobese women, and at the bilateral total hips in obese women. Conclusions. AIs are predictive markers for CVD, and BMD values are predictors of AIs, especially the novel AI, i.e., TG/HDL-C ratio, in nonobese adult men and women after dividing the patients into subgroups to eliminate the effect of BMI as a confounding factor. Thus, BMD values could predict AIs of CVD, especially in nonobese adults.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Proteomic Comparison of Malignant Human Germ Cell Tumor Cell Lines\\n\\nMalignant germ cell tumors (GCT) are the most common malignant tumors in young men between 18 and 40 years. The correct identification of histological subtypes, in difficult cases supported by immunohistochemistry, is essential for therapeutic management. Furthermore, biomarkers may help to understand pathophysiological processes in these tumor types. Two GCT cell lines, TCam-2 with seminoma-like characteristics, and NTERA-2, an embryonal carcinoma-like cell line, were compared by a quantitative proteomic approach using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with stable isotope labelling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC). We were able to identify 4856 proteins and quantify the expression of 3936. 347 were significantly differentially expressed between the two cell lines. For further validation, CD81, CBX-3, PHF6, and ENSA were analyzed by western blot analysis. The results confirmed the MS results. Immunohistochemical analysis on 59 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) normal and GCT tissue samples (normal testis, GCNIS, seminomas, and embryonal carcinomas) of these proteins demonstrated the ability to distinguish different GCT subtypes, especially seminomas and embryonal carcinomas. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of these proteins resulted in an antiproliferative effect in TCam-2, NTERA-2, and an additional embryonal carcinoma-like cell line, NCCIT. In summary, this study represents a proteomic resource for the discrimination of malignant germ cell tumor subtypes and the observed antiproliferative effect after knockdown of selected proteins paves the way for the identification of new potential drug targets.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

However, the underlying mechanisms of DCM remain incompletely understood presently. This study was designed to screen the potential molecules and pathways implicated with DCM. GSE26887 involving 5 control individuals and 7 DCM patients was selected from the GEO database to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DAVID was applied to perform gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was also constructed to visualize the interactions among these DEGs. To further validate significant genes and pathways, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot were performed. A total of 236 DEGs were captured, including 134 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes. GO, KEGG, and the PPI network disclosed that inflammation, immune disorders, metabolic disturbance, and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly enriched in the development of DCM. Notably, IL6 was an upregulated hub gene with the highest connectivity degree, suggesting that it may interact with a great many molecules and pathways. Meanwhile, SOCS3 was also one of the top 15 hub genes in the PPI network. Herein, we detected the protein level of STAT3 and SOCS3 in a mouse model with DCM. Western blot results showed that the protein level of SOCS3 was significantly lower while phosphorylated-STAT3 (P-STAT3) was activated in mice with DCM. In vitro results also uncovered the similar alterations of SOCS3 and P-STAT3 in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts induced by high glucose (HG). However, overexpression of SOCS3 could significantly reverse HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen synthesis of cardiac fibroblasts. Taken together, our analysis unveiled potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in DCM, which could be helpful to the diagnosis and treatment of DCM.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Evaluation of a Novel Missense Mutation in ABCB4 Gene Causing Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 3\\n\\nProgressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a hepatic disorder occurring predominantly in childhood and is difficult to diagnose. PFIC3, being a rare autosomal recessive disease, is caused by genetic mutations in both alleles of ABCB4, resulting in the disruption of the bile secretory pathway. The identification of pathogenic effects resulting from different mutations in ABCB4 is the key to revealing the internal cause of disease. These mutations cause truncation, instability, misfolding, and impaired trafficking of the MDR3 protein. Here, we reported a girl, with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis and progressive liver cirrhosis, with an elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase level. Genetic screening via whole exome sequencing found a novel homozygous missense mutation ABCB4:c.1195G>C:p.V399L, and the patient was diagnosed with PFIC3. Various computational tools predicted the variant to be deleterious and evolutionary conserved. For functional characterization studies, plasmids, encoding ABCB4 wild-type and selected established mutant constructs, were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. In vitro expression analysis observed a reduced expression of mutant protein compared to wild-type protein. We found that ABCB4 wild type was localized at the apical canalicular membrane, while mutant p.V399L showed intracellular retention. Intracellular mistrafficking proteins usually undergo proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. We found that after treatment with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1, MDR3 expression of V399L was significantly increased. A decrease in MDR3 expression of mutant V399L protein may be a result of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. Pharmacological modulator cyclosporin A and intracellular low temperature (30°C) treatment significantly rescued both the folding defect and the active maturation of the mutant protein. Our study identified a novel pathogenic mutation which expanded the mutational spectrum of the ABCB4 gene and may contribute to understanding the molecular basis of PFIC3. Therefore, genetic screening plays a conclusive role in the diagnosis of rare heterogenic disorders like PFIC3.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Targeting mTOR in Glioblastoma: Rationale and Preclinical/Clinical Evidence\\n\\nThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) drives several physiologic and pathologic cellular processes and is frequently deregulated in different types of tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). Despite recent advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in GBM biology, the survival rates of this tumor are still disappointing, primarily due to the lack of efficacious treatments. The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR pathway has emerged as a crucial player in GBM development and progression. However, to date, all the attempts to target this pathway with PI3K, AKT, or mTORC1 inhibitors failed to improve the outcome of patients with GBM. Despite these discouraging results, recent evidence pointed out that the blockade of mTORC2 might provide a useful therapeutic strategy for GBM, with the potential to overcome the limitations that mTORC1 inhibitors have shown so far. In this review, we analyzed the rationale of targeting mTOR in GBM and the available preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the choice of this therapeutic approach, highlighting the different roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in GBM biology.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Combination of Proteasome and Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Overcomes the Impact of Gain-of-Function p53 Mutations\\n\\nMutations in the “guardian of the genome” TP53 predominate in solid tumors. In addition to loss of tumor suppressor activity, a specific subset of missense mutations confers additional oncogenic properties. These “gain-of-function” (GOF) mutations portend poor prognosis across cancer types regardless of treatment. Our objective in this study was to identify novel therapeutic opportunities to overcome the deleterious effects of GOF TP53 mutants. Using gynecologic cancer cell lines with known TP53 mutational status, we established that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor induced cell death in cells with two recurrent GOF TP53 mutations (R175H and R248Q), and addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) enhanced this effect. By contrast, p53-null cancer cells were relatively resistant to the combination. Proteasome inhibition promoted apoptosis of cells with TP53 GOF mutations, potentially through induction of the unfolded protein response. In line with the reported hyperstabilization of GOF p53 protein, cells treated with HDACi exhibited reduced levels of p53 protein. Together, these data form the basis for future clinical studies examining therapeutic efficacy in a preselected patient population with GOF TP53 mutations.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The aim of the present study was to establish associations of salivary potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphate levels with the cardiovascular phenotype determined by carotid ultrasound and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and to identify possible covariates for these associations.  samples of nonstimulated whole buccal saliva were obtained from subjects with (; 59%) or without (; 41%) hypertension. The potassium concentrations were 10-fold higher in saliva compared with plasma, whereas sodium concentrations exhibited the reverse relation between saliva and blood. There were no significant correlations between the levels of sodium, potassium, or calcium in saliva and plasma. All salivary electrolytes, except sodium, were significantly associated with age. In age-adjusted analyses, salivary potassium was significantly associated with carotid artery intima media thickness (cIMT) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and these associations were at the limit of significance in multivariate analyses including prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors. Body mass index was a significant confounder for salivary potassium. Salivary phosphate was significantly associated with cIMT in the multivariate analysis. Salivary potassium, calcium, and phosphate levels were significantly associated with heart rate in the univariate age-adjusted as well as in two different multivariate models, whereas no significant associations between sodium and heart rate were observed. In conclusion, the differential association of salivary electrolytes with cardiovascular phenotypes indicates that these electrolytes should be further studied for their predictive value as noninvasive biomarkers for cardiovascular risk evaluation.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Thus, much more efforts in terms of diagnostics and treatments must be provided in the fight of these outcomes. In this sense, recently, the study of saliva as biological matrix has been identified as a new landmark initiative in the search of novel and useful biomarkers to prevent and diagnose these conditions. Specifically, saliva is a rich reservoir of different proteins and peptides and accessible due to recent advances in molecular biology and specially in targeted and unbiased proteomics technologies. Nonetheless, emerging barriers are an obstacle to the study of the salivary proteome in an effective way.

              " 'Application of Lactoferrin and α1-Antitrypsin in Gingival Retention Fluid to Diagnosis of Periodontal Disease\\n\\nObjectives. Periodontal disease is prevalent and has an inflammation associated with not only oral but also systemic pathologies. The diagnosis by biomarkers is required for clinical practice on periodontal disease. The lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin were both inflammation-related molecules. The present study investigated the relationship between the periodontal status and the two biomarkers in gingival retention fluid (GRF). Patients and Methods. In 63 subjects with periodontitis, the GRF was sampled from maxillary anterior gingiva using a microbrush for 30 seconds. The lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin levels in GRF were measured by an enzyme-link solvent immunoassay. Periodontal status was evaluated by probing pocket depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Results. There was a higher level of these biomarkers in saliva (median (ng/mL), lactoferrin: 3611.9, α1-antitrypsin: 4573.3) than in GRF (lactoferrin: 61.0, α1-antitrypsin: 54.7). There was a mild-to-moderate but significantly positive correlation in lactoferrin or α1-antitrypsin between GRF and saliva. There was a positively mild-to-moderate accuracy (area under the curve: 0.60–0.81) of lactoferrin or α1-antitrypsin in GRF or in saliva to distinguish the severity of periodontal status. The cutoff level (ng/mL) of lactoferrin in GRF for detecting ≥30% of PD\\u2009≥\\u20094\\u2009mm (moderate periodontitis) was 68.6 and for detecting ≥20% of BOP (clinically active periodontitis) was 61.2.

              " 'Usefulness of the Adipokines as Biomarkers of Ischemic Cardiac Dysfunction\\n\\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among both women and men, but there is still a great percentage of misdiagnosis and lack of clearly defined criteria. Advances in biomolecular science have proven the crucial role of inflammation and, more importantly, the role of adipokines in mediating all stages of coronary artery disease. It has also been suggested that regional fat deposits, more precisely from thoracic region, have a major influence on the development of coronary artery disease by creating a local proatherogenic environment. The immune system closely interacts with metabolic risk factors to initiate, promote, and further aggravate the atherosclerotic lesions on the arterial wall all with the “help” of adipokines. So nowadays, research extensively focuses on uncovering biomarkers that would provide an increased chance of detecting subclinical cardiac distress and also add a consistent value to current guideline-imposed risk criteria.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Adipokines as Biomarkers in Health and Disease\\n\\nAdipokines are important circulating factors mediating intertissue crosstalk throughout the body and thus playing a key role in maintaining endocrine homeostasis. So far, multiple associations of adipokines with widespread noncommunicable diseases, including cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and fertility problems, have been identified. However, the precise mechanisms underlying empirically observed associations are still rather poorly understood, and more research must be carried out in order to make sense of and deepen the already published data.\\n\\nA better understanding of associations of adipokine expression and common diseases seems warranted, and the journal set out to publish this special issue. The preparation of this special issue resulted in a series of 5 articles, submitted by researchers from Kuwait, Czech Republic, Germany, and China. All the published studies were approved by the local Ethical Committees, and the statements are included in the Method section of the respective papers.\\n\\nFirst, T. Pavlova et al. (Czech Republic), in their work titled “Irisin Maternal Plasma and Cord Blood Levels in Mothers with Spontaneous Preterm and Term Delivery,” focused on the possible association of irisin levels—a protective exercise-induced myokine—with preterm birth and concluded that irisin levels in cord blood were significantly different between preterm and term pregnancies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study ever to report the association of irisin cord blood levels with preterm birth.\\n\\nSecond, A. Koch et al. (Germany) in their work titled “Visfatin Serum Levels Predict Mortality in Critically Ill Patients” focused on the potential of visfatin to predict mortality of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Visfatin is an adipokine also called nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which displays insulin-mimicking effects. The authors report that the visfatin serum concentrations were strongly associated with disease severity and organ failure, irrespectively of the possible presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Moreover, the authors observed that visfatin levels correlated with biomarkers of renal failure, liver dysfunction, and other adipokines (e.g., resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in their cohort. Last but not least, high visfatin levels at ICU admission were predictive of an increased mortality, both at the ICU and during a long-term follow-up of approximately two years. Such findings emphasize strongly the need for a replication study of the potential of visfatin for the prediction of organ failure and/or overall survival in ICU patients.\\n\\nLastly, three papers focused on the possible associations of specific adipokines with insulin sensitivity or T2DM with or without concomitant metabolic syndrome: (i) F. Wang et al. from China (manuscript titled “Circulating PGRN Levels Are Increased but Not Associated with Insulin Sensitivity or β-Cell Function in Chinese Obese Children”) investigated the association of progranulin with insulin sensitivity or β-cell function in a Chinese paediatric cohort, (ii) N. A. Abdella and O. A. Mojiminiyi from Kuwait (manuscript titled “Clinical Applications of Adiponectin Measurements in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Screening, Diagnosis, and Marker of Diabetes Control”) focused on adiponectin as a potential diagnostic marker for T2DM or insulin resistance, and (iii) P. Yan et al. from China (manuscript titled “Plasma Neuregulin 4 Levels Are Associated with Metabolic Syndrome in Patients Newly Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus”) investigated the link between neuregulin 4 and metabolic syndrome in newly diagnosed T2DM patients. Each of these works provides unique insights into the field, suggesting, respectively, that (i) progranulin is associated with higher BMI and multiple parameters of obesity in obese children, (ii) adiponectin may be useful as possible diagnostic/therapeutic markers in T2DM, and (iii) neuregulin 4 is associated with parameters of metabolic syndrome in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.\\n\\nTaken together, the presented papers further emphasize the complexity of the adipokine network that likely serves as master relays for integrating the influences of environmental factors with the genetic and epigenetic makeup of every individual. All the included papers further highlight the importance of larger prospective studies as well as validation studies on different populations of patients and different ethnicities. To conclude, the presented special issue provides a collection of novel findings in the field, contributing possibly to better decision-making in the clinical practice. It should be kept in mind, however, that adipokines are part of large neuroendocrine-immune-metabolic networks, and they exert their effects through complex endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, or juxtacrine crosstalk mechanisms, which should be further investigated with system medicine approaches.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'High-Sensitivity Troponin T and Soluble Form of AXL as Long-Term Prognostic Biomarkers after Heart Transplantation\\n\\nAntecedents. Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a frequent complication limiting the long-term (>1 year) survival after heart transplantation (HTx). CAV is initiated by endothelial dysfunction and can lead to severe cardiovascular (CV) complications. Since CAV is often clinically silent, biomarkers could help identifying HTx patients at risk of CAV and their severe complications. Aim. Evaluate the clinical yield of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), marker of cardiomyocyte damage, and the soluble form of AXL (sAXL), biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, to assess the prognosis of long-term cardiovascular (CV) events occurring after HTx. Methods. 96 patients were evaluated at least\\u2009>\\u20091 year after HTx. CAV was evaluated by coronary angiography or multisliced tomography, and hs-cTnT and sAXL measured 6 months before or after CAV evaluation. Patients were followed during 42\\u2009±\\u200915 months for a combined end point including cardiac death, angina or acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction\\u2009<\\u200950%, or heart failure not due to an acute rejection. Results. 51 patients (53%) presented CAV at evaluation; 21 of them had CV events. Hs-cTnT (56\\u2009±\\u200945 versus 20\\u2009±\\u200918\\u2009ng/L; ) and sAXL concentrations (98\\u2009±\\u200951 versus 26\\u2009±\\u200926\\u2009ng/L; ) were significantly higher in patients with CV events. Hs-cTnT (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.015–1.042, ) and sAXL (HR 1.01; 95% CI 1.001–1.019, ) were independent predictors of CV events. A hs-cTnT concentration\\u2009<\\u200921\\u2009ng/L, detected by AUC ROC, predicted the absence of CV events with a predictive value of 91%; sAXL did not add more predictive value to hs-cTnT. Survival free of CV events was 92% in patients with hs-cTnT\\u2009<\\u200921\\u2009ng/L and 57% in those with hs-cTnT\\u2009>\\u200921\\u2009ng/L (). Conclusion.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is an excellent marker of sepsis but was not extensively studied in cardiology. The present study investigated PCT plasma concentration in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and its prognostic value during 24-month follow-up. Material and Methods. Study group consisted of 130 patients with HFrEF (LVEF\\u2009≤\\u200945%) and 32 controls. PCT level was assessed on admission in all patients. Telephone follow-up was performed every three months over a period of 2 years. Endpoints were death of all causes and readmission for HFrEF exacerbation. Results. HFrEF patients had significantly higher PCT concentration than controls (166.95 versus 22.15\\u2009pg/ml; ). Individuals with peripheral oedema had increased PCT comparing to those without oedema (217.07 versus 152.12\\u2009pg/ml; ). In ROC analysis, PCT turned out to be a valuable diagnostic marker of HFrEF (AUC 0.91; ). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that patients with PCT in the 4th quartile had significantly lower probability of survival than those with PCT in the 1st and 2nd quartiles. In univariate, but not multivariate, analysis, procalcitonin turned out to be a significant predictor of death during 24-month follow-up. (; 95% CI 1.000–1.003; ). Conclusions. Elevated PCT concentration may serve as another predictor of worse outcome in patients with HFrEF.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Visfatin Serum Levels Predict Mortality in Critically Ill Patients\\n\\nThe adipokine visfatin, also termed pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), is mainly derived from adipose tissue but has been implicated in the regulation of innate immune responses. We hypothesized that visfatin could be a potential circulating biomarker in critical illness and sepsis. We therefore measured serum levels of visfatin in a cohort of 229 critically ill medical patients upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In comparison to 53 healthy controls, visfatin levels were significantly elevated in medical ICU patients, especially in patients with sepsis. Visfatin serum concentrations were strongly associated with disease severity and organ failure but did not differ between patients with or without obesity or type 2 diabetes. Visfatin levels correlated with biomarkers of renal failure, liver dysfunction, and other adipokines (e.g., resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in critically ill patients. High visfatin levels at ICU admission indicated an increased mortality, both at the ICU and during long-term follow-up of approximately two years. Our data therefore demonstrate that circulating visfatin is a valuable biomarker for risk and prognosis assessment in critically ill patients. Furthermore, visfatin seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of excessive systemic inflammation, supporting further research on visfatin as a therapeutic target.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Numerous studies have examined the diagnostic and prognostic potencies of circulating cardiac biomarkers in acute coronary syndrome/AMI and heart failure after AMI, and even fewer have depicted the utility of biomarkers in AMI patients undergoing primary PCI. Although complete revascularization at early period of acute coronary syndrome/AMI is an established factor for improved short-term and long-term prognosis and lowered risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications, late adverse cardiac remodelling may be a major risk factor for one-year mortality and postponded heart failure manifestation after PCI with subsequent blood flow resolving in culprit coronary artery. The aim of the review was to focus an attention on circulating biomarker as a promising tool to stratify AMI patients at high risk of poor cardiac recovery and developing HF after successful PCI. The main consideration affects biomarkers of inflammation, biomechanical myocardial stress, cardiac injury and necrosis, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular reparation. Clinical utilities and predictive modalities of natriuretic peptides, cardiac troponins, galectin 3, soluble suppressor tumorogenicity-2, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, growth differential factor-15, midregional proadrenomedullin, noncoding RNAs, and other biomarkers for adverse cardiac remodelling are discussed in the review.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

However, the efficacy of DAAs can be attenuated by the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) before and after treatment. Indeed, RASs detected in DAA treatment-naïve HCV-infected patients could be useful for clinical management and outcome prediction. Although the frequency of naturally occurring HCV NS5A and NS5B RASs has been addressed in many countries, there are only a few reports on their prevalence in the South American region. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RASs to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors in a DAA treatment naïve cohort of Uruguayan patients infected with chronic hepatitis C and compare them with reports from other South American countries. Here, we found that naturally occurring substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors were present in 8% and 19.2%, respectively, of treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients. Importantly, the baseline substitutions in NS5A and NS5B herein identified differ from the studies previously reported in Brazil. Furthermore, Uruguayan strains subtype 1a clustered within all major world clades, showing that HCV variants currently circulating in this country are characterized by a remarkable genetic diversity.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Strong-LAMP Assay Based on a Strongyloides spp.-Derived Partial Sequence in the 18S rRNA as Potential Biomarker for Strongyloidiasis Diagnosis in Human Urine Samples\\n\\nHuman strongyloidiasis a soil-transmitted infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis is one of the most neglected amongst the so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). S. stercoralis is a nematode, which is distributed worldwide; it has been estimated that it could affect millions of people, mainly in tropical and subtropical endemic regions. The difficulties of diagnosis lead to infection rates being underreported. Asymptomatic patients have chronic infections that can lead to severe hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated strongyloidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Strongyloidiasis can easily be misdiagnosed because conventional faecal-based techniques lack of sensitivity for the morphological identification of infective larvae in faeces. None of the currently used molecular methods have used urine samples as an alternative to faecal samples for diagnosing strongyloidiasis. This study was thus aimed at comparing, for the first time, the use of a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) molecular assay (Strong-LAMP) to traditional methods on patients’ urine samples. Twenty-four urine samples were taken from patients included in a study involving two Spanish hospitals for strongyloidiasis screening using parasitological and serological tests. Strongyloides larvae were found in 11 patients’ faecal samples, thereby ascertaining that they had the disease. Other patients had high antibody titres but no larvae were found in their faeces. All urine samples were analysed by PCR and Strong-LAMP assay. No amplification occurred when using PCR. Strong-LAMP led to detecting S. stercoralis DNA in urine samples from patients having previously confirmed strongyloidiasis by parasitological tests and/or a suspicion of being infected by serological ones. The Strong-LAMP assay is a useful molecular tool for research regarding strongyloidiasis in human urine samples. After further validation, the Strong-LAMP assay could also be used for complementary and effective diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in a clinical setting.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major health problem that has high morbidity and mortality around the world. In recent years, long noncoding RNA H19 has been reported to affect the proliferation and apoptosis of vascular cells, which directly or indirectly results in atherosclerosis. We performed a case-control study to explore the relationship between H19 gene polymorphisms (rs2735971, rs2839698, and rs3024270) and the risk of CAD. Methods. We collected 732 samples from Liaoning Province, China, and three polymorphisms in long noncoding RNA H19 were genotyped using the KASP platform. Results. Our data showed that H19 rs2735971 and rs3024270 variant genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of CAD (rs2735971, , , ; rs3024270, , , ). No significant association with the risk of CAD was found for H19 rs2839698 polymorphism (). In haplotype analysis, H19 polymorphisms of rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C haplotype reduced the risk of CAD by 0.61-fold (, , ). In addition, we found that rs2839698 interacted with smoking (), and according to multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, the three-factor model including H19 rs2839698-smoking-drinking was the best model for the risk of CAD (testing balanced ).

Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lncRNAs are considered to be genetic factors that influence cancer susceptibility. The lncRNA GAS5, MEG3, and PCAT-1 polymorphisms are shown to be possibly associated with cancer risk. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate this association. Methods. Studies were selected from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model or fixed-effects model to assess the association between lncRNA polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility. Metaregression and publication bias analyses were also conducted. All analyses were performed using the Stata 12.0 software. Results. Sixteen articles (covering 13750 cases and 17194 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. A significant association between SNP rs145204276 and gastric cancer risk was observed (del vs. ins: , ; del/del vs. ins/ins+del/ins: , ; del/ins vs. ins/ins: , ). For rs16901904, a decreased cancer risk was observed in three genetic models (C vs. T: , ; CC vs. CT+TT: , ; CC vs. TT: , ). No statistical significance was found in the metaregression analysis. For all of the included SNPs, no publication bias was found in all genotype models. Conclusions. The rs145204276 SNP in lncRNA GAS5 is likely to be associated with gastric cancer risk, whereas the rs16901904 SNP in lncRNA PCAT-1 bears association with a decreased cancer risk.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Increasing evidence indicates that hepatic subcapsular flow (HSF) can serve as a noninvasive ultrasonographic marker for the early diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA). However, results regarding its diagnostic accuracy are inconsistent and inconclusive. We conducted this meta-analysis with an aim to systematically evaluate the diagnostic value of HSF in predicting BA. Methods. A comprehensive literature search of four databases was conducted to identify the eligible studies. All analyses were performed using STATA 12.0. Results. Nine studies from eight articles containing 368 patients and 469 controls were included in our meta-analysis. Briefly, the values for pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.95 (95% CI 0.88-0.98), 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.96), 11.6 (95% CI 6.3-21.5), 0.06 (95% CI 0.02-0.14), 201 (95% CI 59-689), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), respectively. Additionally, metaregression along with subgroup analysis based on various covariates revealed the potential sources of heterogeneity and the detailed diagnostic value in each subgroup. Conclusion. Our meta-analysis showed that HSF assay could provide high accuracy in predicting BA patients and non-BA individuals. However, further studies with better design and larger sample size are required to support the results of the present study.\\n BREAKS HERE']"

            "Progression of Aortic Arch Calcification Is Associated with Overall and Cardiovascular Mortality in Hemodialysis\n",
            "\n",
            "Background. Vascular calcification is common and associated with unfavorable outcomes among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Nevertheless, little is known whether the progression of vascular calcification outweighs the baseline calcification in association with overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods. This study included 140 maintenance HD patients. Vascular calcification was assessed using the aortic arch calcification (AoAC) score measured from chest radiographs at the baseline and the second year of follow-up. Progression of vascular calcification (ΔAoAC) was defined as the difference between the two measurements of AoAC. The association of ΔAoAC with overall and CV mortality was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results. During the mean follow-up period of 5.8 years, there were 49 (35%) overall mortality and 27 (19.3%) CV mortality. High brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was positively correlated with ΔAoAC, whereas old age was negatively correlated with ΔAoAC. In multivariate adjusted Cox analysis, increased ΔAoAC (per 1 unit), but not baseline AoAC, was significantly associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.183; 95% CI, 1.056–1.327; ) and CV mortality (HR, 1.194; 95% CI, 1.019–1.398; ). Conclusion. Progression of AoAC outperformed the baseline AoAC in association with increased risk of overall and CV mortality in HD patients. A regular follow-up of chest radiograph and AoAC score assessments are simple and cost-effective to identify the high-risk individuals of unfavorable outcomes in maintenance HD patients.\n",
            " BREAKS HEREA Trypanosoma cruzi Genome Tandem Repetitive Satellite DNA Sequence as a Molecular Marker for a LAMP Assay for Diagnosing Chagas’ Disease\n",
            "\n",
            "Chagas’ disease is a neglected tropical disease caused by Trypanosoma cruzi which is endemic throughout Latin America and is spread by worldwide migration. Diagnosis is currently limited to serological and molecular techniques having variations regarding their sensitivity and specificity. This work was aimed at developing a new sensitive, applicable, and cost-effective molecular diagnosis technique for loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based detection of T. cruzi (Tc-LAMP). The results led to determining a highly homologous satellite repeat region (231 bp) among parasite strains as a molecular marker for diagnosing the disease. Tc-LAMP was performed correctly for detecting parasite DNA (5 fg for the CL Brener strain and 50 fg for the DM28, TcVI, and TcI strains). Assay results proved negative for DNA from 16 helminth species and 7 protozoa, including Leishmania spp. Tc-LAMP based on the highly repeated T. cruzi satellite region is thus proposed as an important alternative for diagnosing T. cruzi infection, overcoming other methods’ limitations such as their analytic capability, speed, and requiring specialized equipment or highly trained personnel. Tc-LAMP could be easily adapted for point-of-care testing in areas having limited resources.\n",

            "\n",
            "Background and Aim. Various methods, including the Child-Pugh score, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, the MELD combined with serum sodium concentration (MELD-Na) score, the integrated MELD (iMELD) score, and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, have been widely used for predicting the survival of decompensated cirrhosis (DeCi) patients. In this study, we defined and compared the prognostic value of these scores to predict mortality in DeCi patients. Methods. We performed a single-center, observational retrospective study and analyzed 456 DeCi patients who were hospitalized in the gastroenterology department. The biochemical examination results and demographic characteristics of the patients were obtained, and five scores were calculated upon admission after 24 hours. All patients were observed until death, loss to follow-up, or specific follow-up times (28 days, 90 days, and 6 months). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the ability of these methods to predict mortality in DeCi patients. Results. At 28 days, 90 days, and 6 months, the cumulative number of deaths was 50 (11.0%), 76 (16.6%), and 91 (19.9%), respectively. The scores were significantly higher in nonsurviving patients than in surviving patients. All scores yielded viable values in predicting 28-day, 90-day, and 6-month prognoses for DeCi patients. The areas under the ROC curve (AUROCs) of the ALBI score were higher than those of the other scores, which were only over 0.700 at 28 days. The AUROC of the MELD score was higher than that of the other scores, including the MELD-Na and iMELD scores, at 90 days and 6 months. Conclusion. All five methods (Child-Pugh score, MELD score, MELD-Na score, iMELD score, and ALBI score) provided a reliable prediction of mortality for both the short-term and long-term prognosis of patients with DeCi. The ALBI score may be particularly useful for assessing short-term outcomes, whereas the MELD score may be particularly useful for assessing long-term outcomes.\n",

            "Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD). The aim of our study was to evaluate plasma and urinary levels of GDF-15 after pediatric renal transplantation (Rtx) and in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its associations to cardiovascular risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, GDF-15 was measured in plasma and urine from 53 children with a renal transplant and 83 children with CKD and related to cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, obesity, and cholesterol) and kidney function. Forty healthy children served as a control group. Plasma levels of GDF-15 (median and range) for a Tx (transplantation) cohort, CKD cohort, and healthy controls were, respectively, 865 ng/L (463-3039 ng/L), 508 ng/L (183-3279 ng/L), and 390 ng/L (306-657 ng/L). The CKD and Tx cohorts both had significantly higher GDF-15 levels than the control group (). Univariate associations between GDF-15 and hyperuricemia (), elevated triglycerides (), low HDL (), and obesity () were found. However, mGFR () and hemoglobin () were the only significant predictors of GDF-15 in an adjusted analysis. Urinary GDF-15/creatinine ratios were 448 ng/mmol (74–5013 ng/mmol) and 540 ng/mmol (5–14960 ng/mmol) in the Tx cohort and CKD cohort, respectively. In the CKD cohort, it was weakly correlated to mGFR (, ). Plasma levels of GDF-15 are elevated in children with CKD and after Rtx. The levels were not associated with traditional cardiovascular risk factors but strongly associated with renal function.\n",

            "\n",
            "Background. sST2 represents a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with heart failure, but limited data is available on its role in patients with hypertension. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-term prognosis value of sST2 for an unfavorable outcome in hypertensive patients. Methods. This was a prospective observational study which enrolled 80 patients with hypertension, who were followed for one year. All patients underwent clinical, laboratory (including sST2), and echocardiographic assessment at baseline. The patients were grouped according to the cardiovascular (CV) events reported during the follow-up: group A (with CV events) and group B (without CV events). Results. Overall, 59 CV events were reported during the follow-up period. Compared to group B, the patients in group A had significantly higher sST2 levels, a higher number of CV risk factors, and a higher left ventricle mass. Except for the diastolic dysfunction parameters, the echocardiographic findings were similar in the two groups. Patients in group A had a lower  ratio, larger deceleration time, and increased telediastolic pressure as quantified by the  ratio than those in group B. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sST2 and fasting plasma glucose at baseline were independent predictors for the CV events reported during the follow-up period.  were associated with poor clinical outcomes (, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Conclusions. sST2 levels were correlated with the risk of adverse CV outcomes in hypertensive patients and may represent a useful prognostic marker in these patients.\n",
            " BREAKS HEREFunctional Characterization of a Missense Variant of MLH1 Identified in Lynch Syndrome Pedigree\n",
            "\n",
            "Lynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRCs) inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. Here, we reported a multigeneration Chinese family clinically diagnosed with LS according to the Amsterdam II criteria. To identify the underlying causative gene for LS in this family, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed. A germline missense variant (c.2054C>T:p.S685F) in exon 18 of MLH1 was successfully identified by WES. Sanger sequencing verified the results of WES and also confirmed the cosegregation of the MLH1 missense variant in all affected members of the family including two unaffected family members. Bioinformatic tools predicted the identified MLH1 variant as deleterious. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed loss of MLH1 and PMS2 protein expression. In vitro expression analysis also revealed that the identified MLH1 missense variant (c.2054C>T:p.S685F) results in reduced expression of both MLH1 and PMS2 proteins. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the missense mutation c.2054C>T in MLH1 was classified as a “pathogenic” variant. Two unaffected family members were later recommended for colonoscopy and other important cancer diagnostic inspections every 1-2 years as both were at higher risk of LS. In conclusion, our findings widen the genotypic spectrum of MLH1 mutations responsible for LS. This study increases the phenotypic spectrum of LS which will certainly help the clinicians in diagnosing LS in multigeneration families. This study also puts emphasis on the importance of genetic counselling for the benefit of asymptomatic carriers of MMR gene variants who are at higher risk of LS.\n",
            " BREAKS HERENew Insights into the Role of Tyro3, Axl, and Mer Receptors in Rheumatoid Arthritis\n",
            "\n",
            "Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease involving joints. Among several pathogenic mechanisms, the impairment of homeostatic regulators of inflammation seems to be critically important to sustain persistent infiltration and activation of immune and stromal cells within the diseased synovium. Tyrosine kinase receptors Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are members of the TAM family. Upon binding their ligands Growth Arrest-Specific gene 6 (Gas6) and Protein S (ProS1), TAM receptors (TAMs) exert numerous and diverse biologic functions. Activated Axl and Mer, for instance, can negatively regulate the inflammatory cascade and mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, contributing to prevent the development of autoimmunity. Thus, a role for TAMs has been hypothesized in RA. In this review, we will summarise unmet clinical needs in RA, depict the biology of TAMs and TAM ligands, focussing on their ability to regulate the immune system and inflammation cascade, and finally offer an overview of the state-of-the-art literature about the putative role of TAM axis in RA.\n",

Meta-analysis showed that robotic surgery had less estimated blood loss (), blood transfusion (), intraoperative complications (), and conversion to open surgery (), and a shorter hospital stay (), but had a longer operation time () in surgical staging of endometrial cancer compared with laparoscopy. There were no significant differences in postoperative complications, the total number of lymph nodes harvested, the number of pelvic lymph nodes harvested, and the number of para-aortic lymph nodes harvested between techniques. Robotic surgery had a longer operation time (), less estimated blood loss (), blood transfusion (), and postoperative complications (), and a shorter hospital stay () compared with laparotomy. There were no significant differences in other variables between techniques. Conclusion. Robotic surgery is a safer surgical approach than laparoscopy and laparotomy in surgical staging of endometrial cancer, with less estimated blood loss, blood transfusion, and conversion, and the same number of lymph nodes harvested.\n",
            " BREAKS HEREThe Accuracy of Single MicroRNAs in Peripheral Blood to Diagnose Ovarian Cancer: An Updated Meta-Analysis\n",
            "\n",
            "Background. Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of death of women due to cancer in the United States. Although carbohydrate antigen 125 has a moderate diagnostic utility, the phenomenon of false-positive exists. As novel effective biomarkers, some single microRNAs (miRNAs) have diagnostic values for ovarian cancer, but the results lack consistency. In order to precisely and comprehensively assess the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer, a meta-analysis is performed. Methods. Articles concerning the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer were searched from databases. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Area under curve (AUC) of the summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curve was also calculated. Results. In total, 22 studies including 8 kinds of single miRNAs were enrolled in this paper (6 studies for miR-200c, 3 studies for miR-200a and miR-200b, and 2 studies for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b). For miR-200c, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.768 (95% CI: 0.722-0.811) and 0.680 (95% CI: 0.624-0.732); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 2.897 (95% CI: 1.787-4.698) and 0.340 (95% CI: 0.276-0.417); the pooled DOR was 8.917 (95% CI: 4.521-17.587); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.815. For miR-200a, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.759 (95% CI: 0.670-0.833) and 0.717 (95% CI: 0.627-0.795); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 3.129 (95% CI: 0.997-9.816) and 0.301 (95% CI: 0.207-0.437); the pooled DOR was 11.323 (95% CI: 3.493-36.711); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.857. For miR-200b, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.853 (95% CI: 0.776-0.912) and 0.775 (95% CI: 0.690-0.846); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 4.327 (95% CI: 0.683-27.415) and 0.225 (95% CI: 0.081-0.625); the pooled DOR was 19.678 (95% CI: 2.812-137.72); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.90. For miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b, each diagnostic value should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies were included. Conclusions. miR-200c, miR-200a, and miR-200b can be useful diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer. More related studies are needed for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b.\n",

            "\n",
            "The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia (PE) and preventative strategies remain unknown. Laboratory markers which can help in identifying PE patients from pregnant women and assessing the severity of PE during pregnancy are worthy to be explored. In this study, a retrospective case-control study was designed to assess whether the serum levels of albumin (ALB), total protein (TP), prealbumin (PA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, fibrinogen (Fbg), platelet (PLT) count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width (PDW) can help in assessing PE and evaluate its severity. 256 pregnant women were enrolled and classified into 3 groups: mild preeclampsia (mPE, ), severe preeclampsia (sPE, ), and healthy normotensive controls (control, ). Our result showed that the serum levels of ALP, LDH, and D-dimer were significantly higher in mild or severe PE patients compared with the healthy controls (66 (52.5-76.5) vs. 168 (141.5-201.25) vs. 182.5 (120-191.5), 152 (139.75-166.25) vs. 183.5 (163.25-307) vs. 282 (215.25-306), 1.05 (0.65-1.57) vs. 3.05 (2.25-4.08) vs. 5.65 (2.29-7.71)), while ALB, TP, and PA are lower (38 (37-42) vs. 31.5 (25.5-34.5) vs. 28.5 (24-33), 65 (63-68.25) vs. 56.5 (52-61) vs. 51.5 (49-58),  vs.  vs. ). On the other hand, compared with the mPE group, the sPE group showed significantly lower PLT count but higher level of LDH, D-dimer, and Fbg. No significant differences in MPV or PDW were found between any of the two groups. In conclusion, the above markers except for the MPV and PDW may be correlated with PE severity in this patient cohort, indicating possible values of these potential biomarkers in auxiliary diagnosis and severity assessment of PE.\n",

To evaluate the diagnostic value of low-dose 256-slice CT angiography (CTA), MR angiography (MRA), and three dimensional-digital subtraction angiography (3D-DSA) in cerebral aneurysms. Methods. CTA, MRA, and 3D-DSA were performed in all enrolled patients to explore the diagnostic significance of the three different examinations. Results. There were 92 aneurysms confirmed during DSA and surgery in 79 patients. The diagnostic coincidence rates of DSA, CTA, and MRA were 96.7%, 89.1%, and 86%, respectively. The diagnostic coincidence rates of CTA and MRA were lower than those of DSA. The detection rate of CTA for aneurysms less than 3 mm in diameter was higher than that of MRA. Conclusion. CTA, DSA, and MRA have their own advantages and disadvantages in the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms. They all have the diagnostic value for aneurysms.\n",

            "Backgrounds. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) has been regarded as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we evaluated FASN expression at both mRNA and protein levels and assessed the association between FASN expression and prognosis in male Han Chinese with PCa treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods. Expression profile and prognostic value of FASN were analyzed in tissue microarray (TMA) and data retrieved from databases including TCGA public database, GEO database, and our sequencing data with whole clinicopathological characteristics. Results. FASN expression was associated with clinical parameters and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. The relative expression of FASN mRNA was higher in the tumor tissue in all public databases and our sequencing data (). A similar result was seen in tissue microarray (TMA) (). Analysis of our sequencing data indicated that FASN’s relative expression was associated with tumor stage (), and FASN expression was positively associated with the Gleason score () and seminal vesicle invasion () in TMA. We found that high FASN expression was an independent predictor of shorter BCR-free survival with univariate and multivariate survival analysis (), rendering FASN an optimal prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with prostate cancer. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that FASN was overexpressed at mRNA and protein levels in PCa. We found that patients with high FASN expression had a shorter BCR-free survival, showing its value as a prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with PCa.\n",

            "\n",
            "Chagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi which is endemic in Latin America. T. cruzi infection results in a latent infection with approximately a third of latently infected patients developing chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM). CCM is a common cause of cardiomyopathy in endemic regions and has a poor prognosis compared to other cardiomyopathies. The factors responsible for the transition from the asymptomatic indeterminate latent stage of infection to CCM are poorly understood. Our previous studies demonstrated that lipid metabolism and diet are important determinants of disease progression. In the present study, we analyzed various serum metabolomic biomarkers such as acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids in murine models of CCM, where the mice specifically develop either left or right ventricular cardiomyopathy based on the diets fed during the indeterminate stage in a murine model of Chagas disease. Our data provide new insights into the metabolic changes that may predispose patients to CCM and biomarkers that may help predict the risk of developing cardiomyopathy from T. cruzi infection. Author Summary. Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) is a parasitic disease prevalent in Latin America. Currently, no effective drugs or vaccines are available to prevent or cure CCM. The factors involved in the disease severity and progression are poorly understood to design new therapeutic interventions. In order to rapidly identify Chagas patients with a higher risk to develop CCM, a new set of biomarkers specific to Chagas disease is needed. We performed serum metabolomic analyses in chronic T. cruzi-infected mice fed on different diets and identified cardiac ventricular-specific metabolite biomarkers that could define CCM severity. In this paper, we present the results of serum metabolomic analyses and discuss its correlations to the diet-induced metabolic regulations in the pathogenesis of CCM in a murine model of Chagas disease.\n",

            "\n",
            "The current study demonstrates that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif- (ADAMTS-) 5 is a key extracellular matrix protease and associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels and relevance of coronary artery disease (CAD) remain largely unknown. This study is aimed at examining the relationship between the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels and the severity of coronary stenosis in patients with CAD. In the present study, the expression of ADAMTS-5 was analyzed in coronary artery samples and blood. The results showed that the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels were lower in the CAD group than in the control group. In addition, significantly higher matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 2 and MMP-9 levels were also observed in the patients with CAD, and the ADAMTS-5 levels were negatively correlated with the MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the Gensini score was negatively correlated with the ADAMTS-5 levels but was positively correlated with the MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that ADAMTS-5, MMP-2, and MMP-9 may have a certain diagnostic value in CAD and that the combination of all three metalloproteinases had a higher diagnostic value. The findings provided a better understanding of the role of ADAMTS-5 in the diagnosis of CAD.\n",

            "Objective. To investigate ultrasonographically the salivary glands and to correlate ultrasonographic parameters with focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and stimulated salivary flow rate. Material and Methods. 32 patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) and 32 healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study, performed in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, “Victor Babeș” University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timișoara, Romania. All the patients and controls were examined by salivary gland ultrasonography (B-mode, color and spectral Doppler, and sonoelastography), determining the following parameters: salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) score, resistive index (RI) of transverse facial artery, and shear wave velocity (SWV). Serum beta-2-microglobulin and stimulated saliva amount were determined in all the patients and controls. Minor salivary gland biopsy with focus score assessment was done in pSS patients. Results. Patients with pSS presented higher SGUS score and parotid and submandibular SWV and reduced RI of transverse facial artery than controls (). In pSS patients, statistically significant correlations were identified between assessed ultrasonographic parameters and focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and respective stimulated saliva flow ().

            "\n",
            "Background. Galectin-3 plasma levels (gal-3) were shown to correlate with the scar burden in chronic heart failure (CHF) setting. As scar burden predicts response to stem cell therapy, we sought to explore a correlation between gal-3 and response to CD34+ cell transplantation in patients with CHF. Methods. We performed a post hoc analysis of patients, enrolled in 2 prospective trials investigating the clinical effects of CD34+ cell therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). CD34+ cells were mobilized by G-CSF, collected via apheresis, and injected transendocardially using NOGA system. Patients were followed for 3 months and demographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical parameters and gal-3 were analyzed at baseline and at follow-up. Response to cell therapy was defined as an LVEF increase of ≥5%. Results. 61 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 52 years and 83% were male. DCMP and ICMP were present in 69% and 31% of patients, respectively. The average serum creatinine was  μmol/L, NT-proBNP 1132 (IQR 350-2279) pg/mL, and LVEF %. Gal-3 at baseline and at 3 months did not differ significantly ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ), and there were no differences in baseline gal-3 with respect to heart failure etiology ( ng/mL in ICMP vs.  ng/mL in DCMP; ). Comparing responders () to nonresponders (), we found no differences in baseline gal-3 ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ). However, responders had significantly lower gal-3 at 3-month follow-up ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ). Also, responders demonstrated a significant decrease in gal-3 over 3 months, while in nonresponders, an increase in gal-3 occurred ( ng/mL vs. ng/mL; ). Conclusions. In patients with chronic heart failure undergoing CD34+ cell therapy, a decrease in galectin-3 plasma levels is associated with beneficial response to this treatment modality. Further prospective data is warranted to confirm our findings and to deepen our understanding of the role of gal-3 in the field of stem cell therapy.\n",

            "\n",
            "Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as potential biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling in postinfarction heart failure (HF). However, the diagnostic reproducibility of the use of circulating miRNAs may be affected by the temporal expression of miRNAs following myocardial infarction (MI). In the current study, using a MI-induced HF rat cohort (4-, 8-, and 12-week post-MI groups), we investigated the temporal expression of plasma miRNAs during the development of left ventricular remodeling. The plasma miRNA expression profile was obtained using miRNA sequencing. The expression of candidate miRNAs in plasma and tissues was examined with real-time PCR. Target genes of candidate miRNAs were predicted using a parallel miRNA-messenger RNA expression profiling approach. The value of plasma miRNAs as biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling was evaluated in patients with postinfarction HF () and control patients with stable angina and without significant coronary lesions and HF () with real-time PCR. Although the expression levels of miR-20a-5p, miR-340-5p, and let-7i-5p were temporally regulated in plasma, myocardium, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression levels of plasma miRNAs, especially miR-20a-5p, were associated with the development of left ventricular remodeling in the postinfarction HF rat cohort. The target genes of these 3 miRNAs were associated with the mechanistic target of rapamycin, nuclear factor-κB, tumour necrosis factor, apoptosis, and p53 signaling pathways. Additionally, the plasma levels of miR-20a-5p, miR-340-5p, and let-7i-5p were significantly increased in patients with postinfarction HF. However, only the expression levels of miR-20a-5p presented significant positive correlations with left ventricular internal end diastolic dimension and left ventricular end diastolic volume. In conclusion, the expression levels of plasma miR-20a-5p were significantly associated with the degree of left ventricular dilatation, and plasma miR-20a-5p may be a potential biomarker for postinfarction left ventricular remodeling.\n",

            "\n",
            "A century after the discovery of Chagas disease, studies are still needed to establish the complex pathophysiology of this disease. However, it is known that several proteins and molecules are related to the establishment of this disease, its evolution, and the appearance of its different clinical forms. Metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, galectins, and TGF-β are involved in the process of infection and consequently the development of myocarditis, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis upon infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. Thus, considering that the heart is one of the main target organs in Chagas disease, knowledge regarding the mechanisms of action of these molecules is essential to understand how they interact and trigger local and systemic reactions and, consequently, determine whether they contribute to the development of Chagas’ heart disease. In this sense, it is believed that the inflammatory microenvironment caused by the infection alters the expression of these proteins favoring progression of the host-parasite cycle and thereby stimulating cardiac tissue remodeling mechanisms and fibrosis. The aim of this review was to gather information on metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, galectins, and TGF-β and discuss how these molecules and their different interrelationships contribute to the development of Chagas’ heart disease.\n",

            "CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) can produce different biological effects by binding to its receptors: CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). CXCL8 and its receptors are associated with the development of various tumor types, especially colorectal cancer and its liver metastases. In addition to promoting angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, migration, and the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, CXCL8 and its receptors have also been known to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells, to help them to escape host immunosurveillance as well as to enhance resistance to anoikis, which promotes the formation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and their colonization of distant organs. In this paper, we will review the established roles of CXCL8 signaling in CRC and discuss the possible strategies of targeting CXCL8 signaling for overcoming CRC drug resistance and cancer progression, including direct targeting of CXCL8/CXCR1/2 or indirect targeting through the inhibition of CXCL8-CXCR1/2 signaling.\n",

            "Aims. Early detection of patients at high risk for progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery remains a major challenge. We aim to evaluate the utility of urinary matrix metalloproteinase-7 (uMMP-7) and other reported biomarkers for predicting AKI progression during postoperative hospital stay. Methods. We conducted a prospective, multicenter cohort study in 121 adult patients with stage 1 or 2 AKI after cardiac surgery. uMMP-7 and other well-reported biomarkers (uIL-18, uNGAL, and UACR) were measured at time of AKI clinical diagnosis. The primary outcome is the progression of AKI after cardiac surgery, defined as worsening of AKI stage (stage 1 to either stage 2 or stage 3 or from stage 2 to stage 3). Results. A level of  at time of AKI diagnosis conveyed an 8-fold risk of AKI progression as compared to those with  after adjusting for clinical risk factors. The performance of uMMP-7 for predicting progressive AKI was good with an AUC of 0.80. The combination of uMMP-7 and IL-18 produces the greatest AUC for predicting progressive AKI. Addition of uMMP-7 to the clinical risk factor model significantly improved risk reclassification for AKI progression. Conclusions. uMMP-7, measured at time of AKI clinical diagnosis, is a novel biomarker for predicting the progression of AKI after cardiac surgery. Adding uMMP-7 to the clinical risk factor model may be used as a noninvasive approach to identify a subpopulation that is at high risk for progressive AKI after cardiac surgery.\n",

            "\n",
            "Objective. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a major cause of late stillbirth, though not all compromised babies remain small or are considered growth restricted as pregnancy progresses. Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (f-MRI) represents a second-line tool to study pregnancies with IUGR fetuses. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of f-MRI on predicting fetal growth and the offspring’s perinatal respiratory outcome. Design. All f-MRI performed between 2014 and 2016 in Siena were analysed. Pregnancies with IUGR (Study group (SG)) were recruited together with a control population (Control group (CG)), coupled for gestational age (GA) at the time of f-MRI (mean GA 31 wks). Neonatal information was collected. The f-MRI protocol consisted of T2w images. Six regions of interest (ROI) were placed as follows: 2 on the lung, 2 on the liver, and 2 on the amniotic fluid. The signal intensities (SI) of each ROI were measured. The SI lung to liver ratio (SI lung/liver) and SI lung to amniotic fluid ratio (SI lung/amniotic fluid) were obtained for each fetus. Each ratio was compared between SG and CG. Therefore, SG was divided into two subgroups: adequate and small for gestational age (AGA and SGA) newborns. All measurements were related to offspring’s perinatal respiratory outcome. Results. SI lung/liver was linearly related with GA at the time of f-MRI and with EFW. SI lung/amniotic fluid was significantly higher in SG than in CG (). In contrast, among SG, lower values of SI lung/amniotic fluid were found in the SGA compared to AGA (). The days of oxygen supply were higher in the SGA subgroup than in the AGA subgroup (). Conclusions. SI lung/liver increases with fetal lung maturation and appears to be useful to estimate intrauterine fetal growth. SI lung/amniotic fluid seems to be a reliable predictive index to distinguish the IUGR fetuses that can recover their growth from those that were born SGA. f-MRI represents a promising frontier to predict IUGR fetus outcome, thus contributing to ameliorate the perinatal management.\n",

            "Background. The evaluation of the long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an established clinical process. Laboratory markers may significantly help with the risk stratification of these patients. Our objective was to find the relation of selected microRNAs to the standard markers of AMI and determine if these microRNAs can be used to identify patients at increased risk. Methods. Selected microRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499) were measured in a cohort of 122 patients from the PRAGUE-18 study (ticagrelor vs. prasugrel in AMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI)). The cohort was split into two subgroups: 116 patients who did not die (survivors) and 6 patients who died (nonsurvivors) during the 365-day period after AMI. Plasma levels of selected circulating miRNAs were then assessed in combination with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Results. miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 correlated positively with NT-proBNP and hsTnT 24 hours after admission and negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Both miR-1 and miR-133a positively correlated with hsTnT at admission. Median relative levels of all selected miRNAs were higher in the subgroup of nonsurvivors () in comparison with survivors (), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. All patients in the nonsurvivor subgroup had miR-499 and NT-proBNP levels above the cut-off values (891.5 ng/L for NT-proBNP and 0.088 for miR-499), whereas in the survivor subgroup, only 28.4% of patients were above the cut-off values (). Conclusions. Statistically significant correlation was found between miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 and hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and LVEF. In addition, this analysis suggests that plasma levels of circulating miR-499 could contribute to the identification of patients at increased risk of death during the first year after AMI, especially when combined with NT-proBNP levels.\n",

            "Background and Objectives. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a silent disease characterised by aortic wall expansion and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dedifferentiation from contractile to synthetic phenotype. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in VSMC phenotypic regulation could be considered as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets of TAA. In vitro studies show that lncRNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, MALAT1, and SMILR are associated with the VSMC phenotypic state. Our aim was to test if these lncRNAs are dysregulated during TAA formation in clinical patient samples. Materials and Methods. Relative expression of lncRNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, SMILR, and MALAT1 was tested in clinical aortic tissue and blood plasma samples from TAA and non-TAA patients using the qRT-PCR method. The Mann–Whitney  test was used to compare ΔCt values between the study groups. ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of plasma lncRNAs. Results. We found significantly reduced CARMN () and LUCAT1 () expression in aortic tissue samples from TAA patients. Relative expression of MALAT1 () and SMILR () did not differ in aortic tissue between the TAA and non-TAA groups. Expression of both LUCAT1 and SMILR was significantly decreased in TAA patients’ blood plasma compared to controls ( and , respectively). However, only LUCAT1 showed the ability to discriminate aneurysmal disease in patients’ blood plasma (, , ). Conclusions. We have shown that the expression of lncRNAs CARMN and LUCAT1 is reduced in dilated aortic tissue and that the LUCAT1 and SMILR expression is lower in the blood plasma of TAA patients. Decreased LUCAT1 expression in TAA patients’ blood plasma may have diagnostic potential in discriminating patients with TAA.\n",

            "Heart failure represents a growing health problem, with increasing morbidity and mortality globally. According to the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure, many biomarkers have been proposed for the timely diagnosis and prognostication of patients with heart failure, but other than natriuretic peptides, none of them has gained enough clinical significance. Renalase, a new protein derived from kidneys was demonstrated to metabolize catecholamines and to have a cardioprotective role. The aim of the study was to determine whether renalase and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration could be used to differentiate heart failure patients stratified to the category of the ejection fraction and whether plasma renalase could be used as a biomarker for left ventricle hypertrophy in all subgroups of heart failure patients. We included patients diagnosed with heart failure and stratified them to the three subgroups according to the ejection fraction. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, HFmrEF had an intermediate profile in between HFrEF and HFpEF, with statistical significance in most evaluated parameters. BNP concentration was significantly different in all three subgroups (), and renalase was statistically higher in HFrEF () compared to the HFmrEF and HFpEF, where its results were similar, without statistical significance. Renalase plasma concentration was demonstrated to be highly and positively associated with left ventricle mass index in HFrEF (), as well as increased plasma concentration of BNP (). In the HFmrEF group of patients, body mass index was positively associated with LVMI (), while in the patients with HFpEF, diabetes mellitus was demonstrated to have a positive association with LVMI (). These findings suggest that renalase concentration may be measured in order to differentiate patients with reduced ejection fraction. Plasma renalase concentrations positively correlated with left ventricle hypertrophy in patients with reduced ejection fraction, being strongly associated with increased left ventricular mass index.\n",

            "Background and Aims. Resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves mortality and induces reverse remodeling in heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction and wide QRS. Nonetheless, some patients do not improve despite the optimal medical therapy and right indications for device implantation. Therefore, finding biomarkers suitable for identification of those patients is crucial. Vitamin D plays a classic hormonal role in the regulation of bone metabolism and also has physiological functions in wide range of nonskeletal tissues. Based on recent studies, low levels of vitamin D seem to directly contribute to pathogenesis and worsening of HF. We planned to assess the role of vitamin D levels on clinical outcomes of HF patients undergoing CRT. Methods and Results. We enrolled 136 HF patients undergoing CRT. Total plasma vitamin D levels were measured at baseline and 6 months later. Primary endpoint was 5-year all-cause mortality; secondary endpoint was lack of good clinical response, defined as less than 15% increase of left ventricular ejection fraction after six months. During follow-up, 58 patients reached the primary, and 45 patients reached the secondary endpoint. Vitamin D levels less than 24.13 ng/mL predicted 5-year mortality () and poor clinical response () after adjusting to all significant baseline predictors. Conclusion. Our study showed that vitamin D deficiency has a significant impact in heart failure patients; it is an independent predictor of lack of midterm clinical response and long-term mortality in patients undergoing CRT. Therefore, monitoring vitamin D status of heart failure patients could be of clinical significance.\n",
            " BREAKS HEREAssociation of Galectin-3 and Soluble ST2, and Their Changes, with Echocardiographic Parameters and Development of Heart Failure after ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction\n",
            "\n",
            "Purpose. To investigate the association of galectin-3 (Gal-3) and soluble ST2 (sST2) and their follow-up changes with the development of heart failure (HF) and echocardiographic parameters of HF (ejection fraction, atrial and ventricular size, left ventricular hypertrophy, e, and E/e) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). Methods. A prospective, observational study, BIOSTRAT (Biomarkers for Risk Stratification After STEMI), enrolled 117 patients between October 2014 and April 2017. Gal-3 and sST2 serum collection and echocardiography were performed twice (during index hospitalization and on a control visit at one-year follow-up). The primary endpoint was HF onset at one-year follow-up. Secondary assessments included associations of biomarker concentration with echocardiographic indices of systolic and diastolic dysfunction at baseline and at one year. Results. Mean baseline concentrations of Gal-3 and sST2 (7.5 and 26.4 ng/mL, respectively) were significantly increased at one-year follow-up (8.5 ng/mL and  and 31.4 ng/mL and , respectively). Patients who reached the primary endpoint (50 patients (48%)) had significantly higher baseline concentrations of both biomarkers and a higher Gal-3 level at one year compared to patients who did not. Both Gal-3 and sST2 were predictors of the primary endpoint in univariate logistic regression analysis, but only Gal-3 remained significant in multivariate analysis. There was no clear association between both biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters. Conclusions. Baseline, but not one-year, changes of Gal-3 and sST2 concentrations may be useful for risk stratification after STEMI. However, only Gal-3 was the independent predictor of HF development at one-year observation. This trial is registered with NCT03735719.\n",

            "\n",
            "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an irreversible loss of kidney function, and it represents a major global public health burden due to both its prevalence and its continuously increasing incidence. Mineral bone disorders (MBDs) constitute a hallmark of CKD, and alongside cardiovascular complications, they underlie a poor prognosis for these patients. Thus, our study focused on novel CKD biomarker patterns and their impact on the clinical staging of the disease. As a first testing approach, the relative expression levels of 105 proteins were assessed by the Proteome Profiler Cytokine Array Kit for pooled CKD stage 2–4 serum samples to establish an overall view regarding the proteins involved in CKD pathogenesis. Among the molecules that displayed significant dysregulation in the CKD stages, we further explored the involvement of Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk-1), a recognised inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway, and its crosstalk with 1,25OH2D3 (calcitriol) as new players in renal bone and vascular disease. The serum levels of these two molecules were quantified by an ELISA (76 samples), and the results reveal decreasing circulating levels of Dkk-1 and calcitriol in advanced CKD stages, with their circulating expression showing a downward trend as the CKD develops. In the next step, we analysed the inflammation and MBD biomarkers’ expression in CKD (by xMAP array). Our results show that the molecules involved in orchestrating the inflammatory response, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), as well as the mineral biomarkers osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OPN), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), correlate with Dkk-1 and calcitriol, raising the possibility of them being potential useful CKD biomarkers. These results reveal the impact of different biomarker patterns in CKD staging and severity, thus opening up novel approaches to be explored in CKD clinical management.\n",
            " BREAKS HEREGas6/TAM Signaling Components as Novel Biomarkers of Liver Fibrosis\n",
            "\n",
            "Liver fibrosis consists in the accumulation of extracellular matrix components mainly derived from activated hepatic stellate cells. This is commonly the result of chronic liver injury repair and represents an important health concern. As liver biopsy is burdened with many drawbacks, not surprisingly there is great interest to find new reliable noninvasive methods. Among the many are new potential fibrosis biomarkers under study, some of the most promising represented by the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) serum protein and its family of tyrosine kinase receptors, namely, Tyro3, Axl, and MERTK (TAM). Gas6/TAM system (mainly, Axl and MERTK) has in fact recently emerged as an important player in the progression of liver fibrosis. This review is aimed at giving an overall perspective of the roles played by these molecules in major chronic liver diseases. The most promising findings up to date acknowledge that both Gas6 and its receptor serum levels (such as sAxl and, probably, sMERTK) have been shown to potentially allow for easy and accurate measurement of hepatic fibrosis progression, also providing indicative parameters of hepatic dysfunction. Although most of the current scientific evidence is still preliminary and there are no in vivo validation studies on large patient series, it still looks very promising to imagine a possible future prognostic role for these biomarkers in the multidimensional assessment of a liver patient. One may also speculate on a potential role for this system targeting (e.g., with small molecule inhibitors against Axl) as a therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis management, always bearing in mind that any such therapeutic approach might face toxicity.\n",
            " BREAKS HERERatio of Early Mitral Inflow Velocity to the Global Diastolic Strain Rate and Global Left Ventricular Longitudinal Systolic Strain Predict Overall Mortality and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Hemodialysis Patients\n",
            "\n",
            "Background. The ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to the global diastolic strain rate (E/E’sr) and global longitudinal systolic strain (GLS) of the left ventricle (LV) are emerging indices of diastolic and systolic functions, respectively, for the LV. Their prognostic significance in the prediction of mortality and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes remains underexplored in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods. This prospective study included 190 maintenance HD patients. The E/E’sr ratio and GLS were assessed using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. The clinical outcomes included overall mortality, CV mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The associations between the E/E’sr ratio, GLS, and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The incremental values of the E/E’sr ratio and GLS in outcome prediction were assessed by  changes in Cox models. Results. Over a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, there were 35 overall deaths, 16 CV deaths, and 45 MACE. Impaired diastolic function with a higher E/E’sr ratio was associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.484; 95% CI, 1.201−1.834; ), CV mortality (HR, 1.584; 95% CI, 1.058–2.371; ), and MACE (HR, 1.205; 95% CI, 1.040−1.397; ) in multivariate adjusted Cox analysis. Worsening GLS was associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.276; 95% CI, 1.101−1.480; ), CV mortality (HR, 1.513; 95% CI, 1.088−2.104; ), and MACE (HR, 1.214; 95% CI, 1.103−1.337; ). The E/E’sr ratio and GLS had better outcome prediction than the E to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/E’) ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Moreover, adding the E/E’sr ratio and GLS to Cox models containing relevant clinical and conventional echocardiographic parameters improved the prediction of overall mortality (), CV mortality (), and MACE (). Conclusion. The E/E’sr ratio and GLS, as emerging indices of LV diastolic and systolic functions, significantly predict mortality and CV outcomes and outperform conventional echocardiographic parameters in outcome prediction in HD patients.\n",
            " BREAKS HEREBone Mineral Density as a Predictor of Atherogenic Indexes of Cardiovascular Disease, Especially in Nonobese Adults\n",
            "\n",
            "Purpose. This study is aimed at determining whether bone mineral density (BMD) values are related to atherogenic indexes (AIs) and could predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in southern Taiwanese adults. Methods. Medical records of 3249 adults who underwent health examinations between June 2014 and February 2018 at a regional hospital in southern Taiwan were reviewed. Data collected included health history, anthropomorphic characteristics, exercise habits, diets (vegetarian or nonvegetarian), clinical laboratory results (lipid profile, systemic blood pressure (SBP), glucose level, creatinine (Cre) level, and hemoglobin (Hb) level), and bone mineral density (BMD), which were used to identify the associations of these parameters, especially BMD, with lipid profile and calculated AIs through simple and multiple linear regressions. Results. The mean age of the patients was 58.0 years, and 71.4% were male. Body mass index (BMI), SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, and all BMD values were positively correlated with triglyceride (TG) level and AIs and were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. The significant positive correlations of BMD at all the measured sites with AIs remained after adjusting for age, sex, SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, smoking, exercise habits, and vegetarian state. The expanded adjusting model for TG/HDL-C remained significant at all the BMD measured sites in nonobese men, at bilateral femoral neck and total hips in nonobese women, and at the bilateral total hips in obese women. Conclusions. AIs are predictive markers for CVD, and BMD values are predictors of AIs, especially the novel AI, i.e., TG/HDL-C ratio, in nonobese adult men and women after dividing the patients into subgroups to eliminate the effect of BMI as a confounding factor. Thus, BMD values could predict AIs of CVD, especially in nonobese adults.\n",

            "\n",
            "Malignant germ cell tumors (GCT) are the most common malignant tumors in young men between 18 and 40 years. The correct identification of histological subtypes, in difficult cases supported by immunohistochemistry, is essential for therapeutic management. Furthermore, biomarkers may help to understand pathophysiological processes in these tumor types. Two GCT cell lines, TCam-2 with seminoma-like characteristics, and NTERA-2, an embryonal carcinoma-like cell line, were compared by a quantitative proteomic approach using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with stable isotope labelling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC). We were able to identify 4856 proteins and quantify the expression of 3936. 347 were significantly differentially expressed between the two cell lines. For further validation, CD81, CBX-3, PHF6, and ENSA were analyzed by western blot analysis. The results confirmed the MS results. Immunohistochemical analysis on 59 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) normal and GCT tissue samples (normal testis, GCNIS, seminomas, and embryonal carcinomas) of these proteins demonstrated the ability to distinguish different GCT subtypes, especially seminomas and embryonal carcinomas. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of these proteins resulted in an antiproliferative effect in TCam-2, NTERA-2, and an additional embryonal carcinoma-like cell line, NCCIT. In summary, this study represents a proteomic resource for the discrimination of malignant germ cell tumor subtypes and the observed antiproliferative effect after knockdown of selected proteins paves the way for the identification of new potential drug targets.\n",

            "Diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disorder of the myocardium in diabetic patients, which is one of the critical complications of diabetes giving rise to an increased mortality. However, the underlying mechanisms of DCM remain incompletely understood presently. This study was designed to screen the potential molecules and pathways implicated with DCM. GSE26887 involving 5 control individuals and 7 DCM patients was selected from the GEO database to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DAVID was applied to perform gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was also constructed to visualize the interactions among these DEGs. To further validate significant genes and pathways, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot were performed. A total of 236 DEGs were captured, including 134 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes. GO, KEGG, and the PPI network disclosed that inflammation, immune disorders, metabolic disturbance, and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly enriched in the development of DCM. Notably, IL6 was an upregulated hub gene with the highest connectivity degree, suggesting that it may interact with a great many molecules and pathways. Meanwhile, SOCS3 was also one of the top 15 hub genes in the PPI network. Herein, we detected the protein level of STAT3 and SOCS3 in a mouse model with DCM. Western blot results showed that the protein level of SOCS3 was significantly lower while phosphorylated-STAT3 (P-STAT3) was activated in mice with DCM. In vitro results also uncovered the similar alterations of SOCS3 and P-STAT3 in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts induced by high glucose (HG). However, overexpression of SOCS3 could significantly reverse HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen synthesis of cardiac fibroblasts. Taken together, our analysis unveiled potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in DCM, which could be helpful to the diagnosis and treatment of DCM.\n",
            " BREAKS HEREEvaluation of a Novel Missense Mutation in ABCB4 Gene Causing Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 3\n",
            "\n",
            "Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a hepatic disorder occurring predominantly in childhood and is difficult to diagnose. PFIC3, being a rare autosomal recessive disease, is caused by genetic mutations in both alleles of ABCB4, resulting in the disruption of the bile secretory pathway. The identification of pathogenic effects resulting from different mutations in ABCB4 is the key to revealing the internal cause of disease. These mutations cause truncation, instability, misfolding, and impaired trafficking of the MDR3 protein. Here, we reported a girl, with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis and progressive liver cirrhosis, with an elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase level. Genetic screening via whole exome sequencing found a novel homozygous missense mutation ABCB4:c.1195G>C:p.V399L, and the patient was diagnosed with PFIC3. Various computational tools predicted the variant to be deleterious and evolutionary conserved. For functional characterization studies, plasmids, encoding ABCB4 wild-type and selected established mutant constructs, were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. In vitro expression analysis observed a reduced expression of mutant protein compared to wild-type protein. We found that ABCB4 wild type was localized at the apical canalicular membrane, while mutant p.V399L showed intracellular retention. Intracellular mistrafficking proteins usually undergo proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. We found that after treatment with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1, MDR3 expression of V399L was significantly increased. A decrease in MDR3 expression of mutant V399L protein may be a result of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. Pharmacological modulator cyclosporin A and intracellular low temperature (30°C) treatment significantly rescued both the folding defect and the active maturation of the mutant protein. Our study identified a novel pathogenic mutation which expanded the mutational spectrum of the ABCB4 gene and may contribute to understanding the molecular basis of PFIC3. Therefore, genetic screening plays a conclusive role in the diagnosis of rare heterogenic disorders like PFIC3.\n",

            "The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) drives several physiologic and pathologic cellular processes and is frequently deregulated in different types of tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). Despite recent advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in GBM biology, the survival rates of this tumor are still disappointing, primarily due to the lack of efficacious treatments. The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR pathway has emerged as a crucial player in GBM development and progression. However, to date, all the attempts to target this pathway with PI3K, AKT, or mTORC1 inhibitors failed to improve the outcome of patients with GBM. Despite these discouraging results, recent evidence pointed out that the blockade of mTORC2 might provide a useful therapeutic strategy for GBM, with the potential to overcome the limitations that mTORC1 inhibitors have shown so far. In this review, we analyzed the rationale of targeting mTOR in GBM and the available preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the choice of this therapeutic approach, highlighting the different roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in GBM biology.\n",

            "Mutations in the “guardian of the genome” TP53 predominate in solid tumors. In addition to loss of tumor suppressor activity, a specific subset of missense mutations confers additional oncogenic properties. These “gain-of-function” (GOF) mutations portend poor prognosis across cancer types regardless of treatment. Our objective in this study was to identify novel therapeutic opportunities to overcome the deleterious effects of GOF TP53 mutants. Using gynecologic cancer cell lines with known TP53 mutational status, we established that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor induced cell death in cells with two recurrent GOF TP53 mutations (R175H and R248Q), and addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) enhanced this effect. By contrast, p53-null cancer cells were relatively resistant to the combination. Proteasome inhibition promoted apoptosis of cells with TP53 GOF mutations, potentially through induction of the unfolded protein response. In line with the reported hyperstabilization of GOF p53 protein, cells treated with HDACi exhibited reduced levels of p53 protein. Together, these data form the basis for future clinical studies examining therapeutic efficacy in a preselected patient population with GOF TP53 mutations.\n",

            "Salivary biomarkers may offer a noninvasive and easy sampling alternative in cardiovascular risk evaluation. The aim of the present study was to establish associations of salivary potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphate levels with the cardiovascular phenotype determined by carotid ultrasound and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and to identify possible covariates for these associations.  samples of nonstimulated whole buccal saliva were obtained from subjects with (; 59%) or without (; 41%) hypertension. The potassium concentrations were 10-fold higher in saliva compared with plasma, whereas sodium concentrations exhibited the reverse relation between saliva and blood. There were no significant correlations between the levels of sodium, potassium, or calcium in saliva and plasma. All salivary electrolytes, except sodium, were significantly associated with age. In age-adjusted analyses, salivary potassium was significantly associated with carotid artery intima media thickness (cIMT) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and these associations were at the limit of significance in multivariate analyses including prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors. Body mass index was a significant confounder for salivary potassium. Salivary phosphate was significantly associated with cIMT in the multivariate analysis. Salivary potassium, calcium, and phosphate levels were significantly associated with heart rate in the univariate age-adjusted as well as in two different multivariate models, whereas no significant associations between sodium and heart rate were observed. In conclusion, the differential association of salivary electrolytes with cardiovascular phenotypes indicates that these electrolytes should be further studied for their predictive value as noninvasive biomarkers for cardiovascular risk evaluation.\n",

The diagnosis by biomarkers is required for clinical practice on periodontal disease. The lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin were both inflammation-related molecules. The present study investigated the relationship between the periodontal status and the two biomarkers in gingival retention fluid (GRF). Patients and Methods. In 63 subjects with periodontitis, the GRF was sampled from maxillary anterior gingiva using a microbrush for 30 seconds. The lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin levels in GRF were measured by an enzyme-link solvent immunoassay. Periodontal status was evaluated by probing pocket depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Results. There was a higher level of these biomarkers in saliva (median (ng/mL), lactoferrin: 3611.9, α1-antitrypsin: 4573.3) than in GRF (lactoferrin: 61.0, α1-antitrypsin: 54.7). There was a mild-to-moderate but significantly positive correlation in lactoferrin or α1-antitrypsin between GRF and saliva. There was a positively mild-to-moderate accuracy (area under the curve: 0.60–0.81) of lactoferrin or α1-antitrypsin in GRF or in saliva to distinguish the severity of periodontal status. The cutoff level (ng/mL) of lactoferrin in GRF for detecting ≥30% of PD ≥ 4 mm (moderate periodontitis) was 68.6 and for detecting ≥20% of BOP (clinically active periodontitis) was 61.2. The cutoff level (ng/mL) of α1-antitrypsin in GRF for detecting ≥30% of PD ≥ 4 mm was 54.5 and for detecting ≥20% of BOP was 35.3. Conclusions. The data can promote an application of the measurements of lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin in GRF to clinical practice on periodontal disease.\n",

It has also been suggested that regional fat deposits, more precisely from thoracic region, have a major influence on the development of coronary artery disease by creating a local proatherogenic environment. The immune system closely interacts with metabolic risk factors to initiate, promote, and further aggravate the atherosclerotic lesions on the arterial wall all with the “help” of adipokines.

However, the precise mechanisms underlying empirically observed associations are still rather poorly understood, and more research must be carried out in order to make sense of and deepen the already published data.\n",

Visfatin is an adipokine also called nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which displays insulin-mimicking effects. The authors report that the visfatin serum concentrations were strongly associated with disease severity and organ failure, irrespectively of the possible presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Moreover, the authors observed that visfatin levels correlated with biomarkers of renal failure, liver dysfunction, and other adipokines (e.g., resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in their cohort. Last but not least, high visfatin levels at ICU admission were predictive of an increased mortality, both at the ICU and during a long-term follow-up of approximately two years. Such findings emphasize strongly the need for a replication study of the potential of visfatin for the prediction of organ failure and/or overall survival in ICU patients.\n",

To conclude, the presented special issue provides a collection of novel findings in the field, contributing possibly to better decision-making in the clinical practice. It should be kept in mind, however, that adipokines are part of large neuroendocrine-immune-metabolic networks, and they exert their effects through complex endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, or juxtacrine crosstalk mechanisms, which should be further investigated with system medicine approaches.\n",

CAV is initiated by endothelial dysfunction and can lead to severe cardiovascular (CV) complications. Since CAV is often clinically silent, biomarkers could help identifying HTx patients at risk of CAV and their severe complications. Aim. Evaluate the clinical yield of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), marker of cardiomyocyte damage, and the soluble form of AXL (sAXL), biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, to assess the prognosis of long-term cardiovascular (CV) events occurring after HTx. Methods. 96 patients were evaluated at least > 1 year after HTx. CAV was evaluated by coronary angiography or multisliced tomography, and hs-cTnT and sAXL measured 6 months before or after CAV evaluation. Patients were followed during 42 ± 15 months for a combined end point including cardiac death, angina or acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction < 50%, or heart failure not due to an acute rejection. Results. 51 patients (53%) presented CAV at evaluation; 21 of them had CV events. Hs-cTnT (56 ± 45 versus 20 ± 18 ng/L; ) and sAXL concentrations (98 ± 51 versus 26 ± 26 ng/L; ) were significantly higher in patients with CV events. Hs-cTnT (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.015–1.042, ) and sAXL (HR 1.01; 95% CI 1.001–1.019, ) were independent predictors of CV events. A hs-cTnT concentration < 21 ng/L, detected by AUC ROC, predicted the absence of CV events with a predictive value of 91%; sAXL did not add more predictive value to hs-cTnT. Survival free of CV events was 92% in patients with hs-cTnT < 21 ng/L and 57% in those with hs-cTnT > 21 ng/L (). Conclusion. Hs-cTnT, but not sAXL, measured during the long-term follow-up of HTx patients appears as a helpful biomarker to identify patients at low risk of adverse CV outcomes.\n",

            "\n",
            "Introduction. Procalcitonin (PCT) is an excellent marker of sepsis but was not extensively studied in cardiology. The present study investigated PCT plasma concentration in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and its prognostic value during 24-month follow-up. Material and Methods. Study group consisted of 130 patients with HFrEF (LVEF ≤ 45%) and 32 controls. PCT level was assessed on admission in all patients. Telephone follow-up was performed every three months over a period of 2 years. Endpoints were death of all causes and readmission for HFrEF exacerbation. Results. HFrEF patients had significantly higher PCT concentration than controls (166.95 versus 22.15 pg/ml; ). Individuals with peripheral oedema had increased PCT comparing to those without oedema (217.07 versus 152.12 pg/ml; ). In ROC analysis, PCT turned out to be a valuable diagnostic marker of HFrEF (AUC 0.91; ). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that patients with PCT in the 4th quartile had significantly lower probability of survival than those with PCT in the 1st and 2nd quartiles. In univariate, but not multivariate, analysis, procalcitonin turned out to be a significant predictor of death during 24-month follow-up. (; 95% CI 1.000–1.003; ). Conclusions. Elevated PCT concentration may serve as another predictor of worse outcome in patients with HFrEF.\n",

            "\n",
            "The adipokine visfatin, also termed pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), is mainly derived from adipose tissue but has been implicated in the regulation of innate immune responses. We hypothesized that visfatin could be a potential circulating biomarker in critical illness and sepsis. We therefore measured serum levels of visfatin in a cohort of 229 critically ill medical patients upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In comparison to 53 healthy controls, visfatin levels were significantly elevated in medical ICU patients, especially in patients with sepsis. Visfatin serum concentrations were strongly associated with disease severity and organ failure but did not differ between patients with or without obesity or type 2 diabetes. Visfatin levels correlated with biomarkers of renal failure, liver dysfunction, and other adipokines (e.g., resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in critically ill patients. High visfatin levels at ICU admission indicated an increased mortality, both at the ICU and during long-term follow-up of approximately two years. Our data therefore demonstrate that circulating visfatin is a valuable biomarker for risk and prognosis assessment in critically ill patients. Furthermore, visfatin seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of excessive systemic inflammation, supporting further research on visfatin as a therapeutic target.\n",

            "The prevalence of heart failure (HF) due to cardiac remodelling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) does not decrease regardless of implementation of new technologies supporting opening culprit coronary artery and solving of ischemia-relating stenosis with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Numerous studies have examined the diagnostic and prognostic potencies of circulating cardiac biomarkers in acute coronary syndrome/AMI and heart failure after AMI, and even fewer have depicted the utility of biomarkers in AMI patients undergoing primary PCI. Although complete revascularization at early period of acute coronary syndrome/AMI is an established factor for improved short-term and long-term prognosis and lowered risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications, late adverse cardiac remodelling may be a major risk factor for one-year mortality and postponded heart failure manifestation after PCI with subsequent blood flow resolving in culprit coronary artery. The aim of the review was to focus an attention on circulating biomarker as a promising tool to stratify AMI patients at high risk of poor cardiac recovery and developing HF after successful PCI. The main consideration affects biomarkers of inflammation, biomechanical myocardial stress, cardiac injury and necrosis, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular reparation. Clinical utilities and predictive modalities of natriuretic peptides, cardiac troponins, galectin 3, soluble suppressor tumorogenicity-2, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, growth differential factor-15, midregional proadrenomedullin, noncoding RNAs, and other biomarkers for adverse cardiac remodelling are discussed in the review.\n",

            "\n",
            "Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection treatment has dramatically changed with the advent of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). However, the efficacy of DAAs can be attenuated by the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) before and after treatment. Indeed, RASs detected in DAA treatment-naïve HCV-infected patients could be useful for clinical management and outcome prediction. Although the frequency of naturally occurring HCV NS5A and NS5B RASs has been addressed in many countries, there are only a few reports on their prevalence in the South American region. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RASs to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors in a DAA treatment naïve cohort of Uruguayan patients infected with chronic hepatitis C and compare them with reports from other South American countries. Here, we found that naturally occurring substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors were present in 8% and 19.2%, respectively, of treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients. Importantly, the baseline substitutions in NS5A and NS5B herein identified differ from the studies previously reported in Brazil. Furthermore, Uruguayan strains subtype 1a clustered within all major world clades, showing that HCV variants currently circulating in this country are characterized by a remarkable genetic diversity.\n",
            " BREAKS HEREStrong-LAMP Assay Based on a Strongyloides spp.-Derived Partial Sequence in the 18S rRNA as Potential Biomarker for Strongyloidiasis Diagnosis in Human Urine Samples\n",
            "\n",
            "Human strongyloidiasis a soil-transmitted infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis is one of the most neglected amongst the so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). S. stercoralis is a nematode, which is distributed worldwide; it has been estimated that it could affect millions of people, mainly in tropical and subtropical endemic regions. The difficulties of diagnosis lead to infection rates being underreported. Asymptomatic patients have chronic infections that can lead to severe hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated strongyloidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Strongyloidiasis can easily be misdiagnosed because conventional faecal-based techniques lack of sensitivity for the morphological identification of infective larvae in faeces. None of the currently used molecular methods have used urine samples as an alternative to faecal samples for diagnosing strongyloidiasis. This study was thus aimed at comparing, for the first time, the use of a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) molecular assay (Strong-LAMP) to traditional methods on patients’ urine samples. Twenty-four urine samples were taken from patients included in a study involving two Spanish hospitals for strongyloidiasis screening using parasitological and serological tests. Strongyloides larvae were found in 11 patients’ faecal samples, thereby ascertaining that they had the disease. Other patients had high antibody titres but no larvae were found in their faeces. All urine samples were analysed by PCR and Strong-LAMP assay. No amplification occurred when using PCR. Strong-LAMP led to detecting S. stercoralis DNA in urine samples from patients having previously confirmed strongyloidiasis by parasitological tests and/or a suspicion of being infected by serological ones. The Strong-LAMP assay is a useful molecular tool for research regarding strongyloidiasis in human urine samples. After further validation, the Strong-LAMP assay could also be used for complementary and effective diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in a clinical setting.\n",

            "Background/Aim. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major health problem that has high morbidity and mortality around the world. In recent years, long noncoding RNA H19 has been reported to affect the proliferation and apoptosis of vascular cells, which directly or indirectly results in atherosclerosis. We performed a case-control study to explore the relationship between H19 gene polymorphisms (rs2735971, rs2839698, and rs3024270) and the risk of CAD. Methods. We collected 732 samples from Liaoning Province, China, and three polymorphisms in long noncoding RNA H19 were genotyped using the KASP platform. Results. Our data showed that H19 rs2735971 and rs3024270 variant genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of CAD (rs2735971, , , ; rs3024270, , , ). No significant association with the risk of CAD was found for H19 rs2839698 polymorphism (). In haplotype analysis, H19 polymorphisms of rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C haplotype reduced the risk of CAD by 0.61-fold (, , ). In addition, we found that rs2839698 interacted with smoking (), and according to multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, the three-factor model including H19 rs2839698-smoking-drinking was the best model for the risk of CAD (testing balanced ). Conclusion. Our study demonstrated that some genotypes of H19 rs2735971 and rs3024270 polymorphisms, as well as rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C haplotype, were associated with the risk of CAD in a Chinese population, and these genotypes have the potential to be biomarkers for predicting CAD risk. We also found that rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C may have a significantly lower risk of CAD. The recessive genetic model of rs3024270 could predict the severity of CAD.\n",

            "Purpose. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lncRNAs are considered to be genetic factors that influence cancer susceptibility. The lncRNA GAS5, MEG3, and PCAT-1 polymorphisms are shown to be possibly associated with cancer risk. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate this association. Methods. Studies were selected from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model or fixed-effects model to assess the association between lncRNA polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility. Metaregression and publication bias analyses were also conducted. All analyses were performed using the Stata 12.0 software. Results. Sixteen articles (covering 13750 cases and 17194 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. A significant association between SNP rs145204276 and gastric cancer risk was observed (del vs. ins: , ; del/del vs. ins/ins+del/ins: , ; del/ins vs. ins/ins: , ). For rs16901904, a decreased cancer risk was observed in three genetic models (C vs. T: , ; CC vs. CT+TT: , ; CC vs. TT: , ). No statistical significance was found in the metaregression analysis. For all of the included SNPs, no publication bias was found in all genotype models. Conclusions. The rs145204276 SNP in lncRNA GAS5 is likely to be associated with gastric cancer risk, whereas the rs16901904 SNP in lncRNA PCAT-1 bears association with a decreased cancer risk.\n",

            "Aim. Increasing evidence indicates that hepatic subcapsular flow (HSF) can serve as a noninvasive ultrasonographic marker for the early diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA). However, results regarding its diagnostic accuracy are inconsistent and inconclusive. We conducted this meta-analysis with an aim to systematically evaluate the diagnostic value of HSF in predicting BA. Methods. A comprehensive literature search of four databases was conducted to identify the eligible studies. All analyses were performed using STATA 12.0. Results. Nine studies from eight articles containing 368 patients and 469 controls were included in our meta-analysis. Briefly, the values for pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.95 (95% CI 0.88-0.98), 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.96), 11.6 (95% CI 6.3-21.5), 0.06 (95% CI 0.02-0.14), 201 (95% CI 59-689), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), respectively. Additionally, metaregression along with subgroup analysis based on various covariates revealed the potential sources of heterogeneity and the detailed diagnostic value in each subgroup. Conclusion. Our meta-analysis showed that HSF assay could provide high accuracy in predicting BA patients and non-BA individuals. However, further studies with better design and larger sample size are required to support the results of the present study.\n",

Vascular calcification is common and associated with unfavorable outcomes among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Nevertheless, little is known whether the progression of vascular calcification outweighs the baseline calcification in association with overall and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods. This study included 140 maintenance HD patients. Vascular calcification was assessed using the aortic arch calcification (AoAC) score measured from chest radiographs at the baseline and the second year of follow-up. Progression of vascular calcification (ΔAoAC) was defined as the difference between the two measurements of AoAC. The association of ΔAoAC with overall and CV mortality was evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. Results. During the mean follow-up period of 5.8 years, there were 49 (35%) overall mortality and 27 (19.3%) CV mortality. High brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity was positively correlated with ΔAoAC, whereas old age was negatively correlated with ΔAoAC. In multivariate adjusted Cox analysis, increased ΔAoAC (per 1 unit), but not baseline AoAC, was significantly associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.183; 95% CI, 1.056–1.327; ) and CV mortality (HR, 1.194; 95% CI, 1.019–1.398; ). Conclusion. Progression of AoAC outperformed the baseline AoAC in association with increased risk of overall and CV mortality in HD patients. A regular follow-up of chest radiograph and AoAC score assessments are simple and cost-effective to identify the high-risk individuals of unfavorable outcomes in maintenance HD patients.',\n",

Diagnosis is currently limited to serological and molecular techniques having variations regarding their sensitivity and specificity. This work was aimed at developing a new sensitive, applicable, and cost-effective molecular diagnosis technique for loop-mediated isothermal amplification-based detection of T. cruzi (Tc-LAMP). The results led to determining a highly homologous satellite repeat region (231\\u2009bp) among parasite strains as a molecular marker for diagnosing the disease. Tc-LAMP was performed correctly for detecting parasite DNA (5\\u2009fg for the CL Brener strain and 50\\u2009fg for the DM28, TcVI, and TcI strains). Assay results proved negative for DNA from 16 helminth species and 7 protozoa, including Leishmania spp. Tc-LAMP based on the highly repeated T. cruzi satellite region is thus proposed as an important alternative for diagnosing T. cruzi infection, overcoming other methods’ limitations such as their analytic capability, speed, and requiring specialized equipment or highly trained personnel. Tc-LAMP could be easily adapted for point-of-care testing in areas having limited resources.',\n",
              " 'Assessing the Prognostic Performance of the Child-Pugh, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease, and Albumin-Bilirubin Scores in Patients with Decompensated Cirrhosis: A Large Asian Cohort from Gastroenterology Department\\n\\nBackground and Aim. Various methods, including the Child-Pugh score, the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, the MELD combined with serum sodium concentration (MELD-Na) score, the integrated MELD (iMELD) score, and the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score, have been widely used for predicting the survival of decompensated cirrhosis (DeCi) patients. In this study, we defined and compared the prognostic value of these scores to predict mortality in DeCi patients. Methods. We performed a single-center, observational retrospective study and analyzed 456 DeCi patients who were hospitalized in the gastroenterology department. The biochemical examination results and demographic characteristics of the patients were obtained, and five scores were calculated upon admission after 24 hours. All patients were observed until death, loss to follow-up, or specific follow-up times (28 days, 90 days, and 6 months). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the ability of these methods to predict mortality in DeCi patients. Results. At 28 days, 90 days, and 6 months, the cumulative number of deaths was 50 (11.0%), 76 (16.6%), and 91 (19.9%), respectively. The scores were significantly higher in nonsurviving patients than in surviving patients. All scores yielded viable values in predicting 28-day, 90-day, and 6-month prognoses for DeCi patients. The areas under the ROC curve (AUROCs) of the ALBI score were higher than those of the other scores, which were only over 0.700 at 28 days. The AUROC of the MELD score was higher than that of the other scores, including the MELD-Na and iMELD scores, at 90 days and 6 months. Conclusion. All five methods (Child-Pugh score, MELD score, MELD-Na score, iMELD score, and ALBI score) provided a reliable prediction of mortality for both the short-term and long-term prognosis of patients with DeCi. The ALBI score may be particularly useful for assessing short-term outcomes, whereas the MELD score may be particularly useful for assessing long-term outcomes.',\n",

In this cross-sectional study, GDF-15 was measured in plasma and urine from 53 children with a renal transplant and 83 children with CKD and related to cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, obesity, and cholesterol) and kidney function. Forty healthy children served as a control group. Plasma levels of GDF-15 (median and range) for a Tx (transplantation) cohort, CKD cohort, and healthy controls were, respectively, 865\\u2009ng/L (463-3039\\u2009ng/L), 508\\u2009ng/L (183-3279\\u2009ng/L), and 390\\u2009ng/L (306-657\\u2009ng/L). The CKD and Tx cohorts both had significantly higher GDF-15 levels than the control group (). Univariate associations between GDF-15 and hyperuricemia (), elevated triglycerides (), low HDL (), and obesity () were found. However, mGFR () and hemoglobin () were the only significant predictors of GDF-15 in an adjusted analysis. Urinary GDF-15/creatinine ratios were 448\\u2009ng/mmol (74–5013\\u2009ng/mmol) and 540\\u2009ng/mmol (5–14960\\u2009ng/mmol) in the Tx cohort and CKD cohort, respectively. In the CKD cohort, it was weakly correlated to mGFR (, ). Plasma levels of GDF-15 are elevated in children with CKD and after Rtx.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-term prognosis value of sST2 for an unfavorable outcome in hypertensive patients. Methods. This was a prospective observational study which enrolled 80 patients with hypertension, who were followed for one year. All patients underwent clinical, laboratory (including sST2), and echocardiographic assessment at baseline. The patients were grouped according to the cardiovascular (CV) events reported during the follow-up: group A (with CV events) and group B (without CV events). Results. Overall, 59 CV events were reported during the follow-up period. Compared to group B, the patients in group A had significantly higher sST2 levels, a higher number of CV risk factors, and a higher left ventricle mass. Except for the diastolic dysfunction parameters, the echocardiographic findings were similar in the two groups. Patients in group A had a lower  ratio, larger deceleration time, and increased telediastolic pressure as quantified by the  ratio than those in group B. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sST2 and fasting plasma glucose at baseline were independent predictors for the CV events reported during the follow-up period.  were associated with poor clinical outcomes (, Kaplan-Meier analysis).

              " 'Functional Characterization of a Missense Variant of MLH1 Identified in Lynch Syndrome Pedigree\\n\\nLynch syndrome (LS) is the most common hereditary colorectal cancer (CRCs) inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner. Here, we reported a multigeneration Chinese family clinically diagnosed with LS according to the Amsterdam II criteria. To identify the underlying causative gene for LS in this family, whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed. A germline missense variant (c.2054C>T:p.S685F) in exon 18 of MLH1 was successfully identified by WES. Sanger sequencing verified the results of WES and also confirmed the cosegregation of the MLH1 missense variant in all affected members of the family including two unaffected family members. Bioinformatic tools predicted the identified MLH1 variant as deleterious. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining showed loss of MLH1 and PMS2 protein expression. In vitro expression analysis also revealed that the identified MLH1 missense variant (c.2054C>T:p.S685F) results in reduced expression of both MLH1 and PMS2 proteins. Based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) guidelines, the missense mutation c.2054C>T in MLH1 was classified as a “pathogenic” variant. Two unaffected family members were later recommended for colonoscopy and other important cancer diagnostic inspections every 1-2 years as both were at higher risk of LS. In conclusion, our findings widen the genotypic spectrum of MLH1 mutations responsible for LS. This study increases the phenotypic spectrum of LS which will certainly help the clinicians in diagnosing LS in multigeneration families. This study also puts emphasis on the importance of genetic counselling for the benefit of asymptomatic carriers of MMR gene variants who are at higher risk of LS.',\n",
              " 'New Insights into the Role of Tyro3, Axl, and Mer Receptors in Rheumatoid Arthritis\\n\\nRheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is the most common chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease involving joints. Among several pathogenic mechanisms, the impairment of homeostatic regulators of inflammation seems to be critically important to sustain persistent infiltration and activation of immune and stromal cells within the diseased synovium. Tyrosine kinase receptors Tyro3, Axl, and Mer are members of the TAM family. Upon binding their ligands Growth Arrest-Specific gene 6 (Gas6) and Protein S (ProS1), TAM receptors (TAMs) exert numerous and diverse biologic functions. Activated Axl and Mer, for instance, can negatively regulate the inflammatory cascade and mediate phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, contributing to prevent the development of autoimmunity. Thus, a role for TAMs has been hypothesized in RA. In this review, we will summarise unmet clinical needs in RA, depict the biology of TAMs and TAM ligands, focussing on their ability to regulate the immune system and inflammation cascade, and finally offer an overview of the state-of-the-art literature about the putative role of TAM axis in RA.',\n",

Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of death of women due to cancer in the United States. Although carbohydrate antigen 125 has a moderate diagnostic utility, the phenomenon of false-positive exists. As novel effective biomarkers, some single microRNAs (miRNAs) have diagnostic values for ovarian cancer, but the results lack consistency. In order to precisely and comprehensively assess the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer, a meta-analysis is performed. Methods. Articles concerning the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer were searched from databases. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Area under curve (AUC) of the summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curve was also calculated. Results. In total, 22 studies including 8 kinds of single miRNAs were enrolled in this paper (6 studies for miR-200c, 3 studies for miR-200a and miR-200b, and 2 studies for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b). For miR-200c, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.768 (95% CI: 0.722-0.811) and 0.680 (95% CI: 0.624-0.732); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 2.897 (95% CI: 1.787-4.698) and 0.340 (95% CI: 0.276-0.417); the pooled DOR was 8.917 (95% CI: 4.521-17.587); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.815. For miR-200a, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.759 (95% CI: 0.670-0.833) and 0.717 (95% CI: 0.627-0.795); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 3.129 (95% CI: 0.997-9.816) and 0.301 (95% CI: 0.207-0.437); the pooled DOR was 11.323 (95% CI: 3.493-36.711); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.857. For miR-200b, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.853 (95% CI: 0.776-0.912) and 0.775 (95% CI: 0.690-0.846); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 4.327 (95% CI: 0.683-27.415) and 0.225 (95% CI: 0.081-0.625); the pooled DOR was 19.678 (95% CI: 2.812-137.72); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.90. For miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b, each diagnostic value should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies were included. Conclusions. miR-200c, miR-200a, and miR-200b can be useful diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer. More related studies are needed for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b.',\n",
              " 'Alterations of Several Serum Parameters Are Associated with Preeclampsia and May Be Potential Markers for the Assessment of PE Severity\\n\\nThe precise pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia (PE) and preventative strategies remain unknown. Laboratory markers which can help in identifying PE patients from pregnant women and assessing the severity of PE during pregnancy are worthy to be explored. In this study, a retrospective case-control study was designed to assess whether the serum levels of albumin (ALB), total protein (TP), prealbumin (PA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, fibrinogen (Fbg), platelet (PLT) count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width (PDW) can help in assessing PE and evaluate its severity. 256 pregnant women were enrolled and classified into 3 groups: mild preeclampsia (mPE, ), severe preeclampsia (sPE, ), and healthy normotensive controls (control, ). Our result showed that the serum levels of ALP, LDH, and D-dimer were significantly higher in mild or severe PE patients compared with the healthy controls (66 (52.5-76.5) vs. 168 (141.5-201.25) vs. 182.5 (120-191.5), 152 (139.75-166.25) vs. 183.5 (163.25-307) vs. 282 (215.25-306), 1.05 (0.65-1.57) vs. 3.05 (2.25-4.08) vs. 5.65 (2.29-7.71)), while ALB, TP, and PA are lower (38 (37-42) vs. 31.5 (25.5-34.5) vs. 28.5 (24-33), 65 (63-68.25) vs. 56.5 (52-61) vs. 51.5 (49-58),  vs.  vs. ). On the other hand, compared with the mPE group, the sPE group showed significantly lower PLT count but higher level of LDH, D-dimer, and Fbg. No significant differences in MPV or PDW were found between any of the two groups. In conclusion, the above markers except for the MPV and PDW may be correlated with PE severity in this patient cohort, indicating possible values of these potential biomarkers in auxiliary diagnosis and severity assessment of PE.',\n",

To evaluate the diagnostic value of low-dose 256-slice CT angiography (CTA), MR angiography (MRA), and three dimensional-digital subtraction angiography (3D-DSA) in cerebral aneurysms. Methods. CTA, MRA, and 3D-DSA were performed in all enrolled patients to explore the diagnostic significance of the three different examinations. Results. There were 92 aneurysms confirmed during DSA and surgery in 79 patients. The diagnostic coincidence rates of DSA, CTA, and MRA were 96.7%, 89.1%, and 86%, respectively. The diagnostic coincidence rates of CTA and MRA were lower than those of DSA. The detection rate of CTA for aneurysms less than 3\\u2009mm in diameter was higher than that of MRA. Conclusion. CTA, DSA, and MRA have their own advantages and disadvantages in the diagnosis of cerebral aneurysms. They all have the diagnostic value for aneurysms.',\n",
              " 'FASN Protein Overexpression Indicates Poor Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer\\n\\nBackgrounds. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) has been regarded as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we evaluated FASN expression at both mRNA and protein levels and assessed the association between FASN expression and prognosis in male Han Chinese with PCa treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods. Expression profile and prognostic value of FASN were analyzed in tissue microarray (TMA) and data retrieved from databases including TCGA public database, GEO database, and our sequencing data with whole clinicopathological characteristics. Results. FASN expression was associated with clinical parameters and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. The relative expression of FASN mRNA was higher in the tumor tissue in all public databases and our sequencing data (). A similar result was seen in tissue microarray (TMA) (). Analysis of our sequencing data indicated that FASN’s relative expression was associated with tumor stage (), and FASN expression was positively associated with the Gleason score () and seminal vesicle invasion () in TMA. We found that high FASN expression was an independent predictor of shorter BCR-free survival with univariate and multivariate survival analysis (), rendering FASN an optimal prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with prostate cancer. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that FASN was overexpressed at mRNA and protein levels in PCa. We found that patients with high FASN expression had a shorter BCR-free survival, showing its value as a prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with PCa.',\n",
              " 'Diet Alters Serum Metabolomic Profiling in the Mouse Model of Chronic Chagas Cardiomyopathy\\n\\nChagas disease is caused by Trypanosoma cruzi which is endemic in Latin America. T. cruzi infection results in a latent infection with approximately a third of latently infected patients developing chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM). CCM is a common cause of cardiomyopathy in endemic regions and has a poor prognosis compared to other cardiomyopathies. The factors responsible for the transition from the asymptomatic indeterminate latent stage of infection to CCM are poorly understood. Our previous studies demonstrated that lipid metabolism and diet are important determinants of disease progression. In the present study, we analyzed various serum metabolomic biomarkers such as acylcarnitines, amino acids, biogenic amines, glycerophospholipids, and sphingolipids in murine models of CCM, where the mice specifically develop either left or right ventricular cardiomyopathy based on the diets fed during the indeterminate stage in a murine model of Chagas disease. Our data provide new insights into the metabolic changes that may predispose patients to CCM and biomarkers that may help predict the risk of developing cardiomyopathy from T. cruzi infection. Author Summary. Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy (CCM) is a parasitic disease prevalent in Latin America. Currently, no effective drugs or vaccines are available to prevent or cure CCM. The factors involved in the disease severity and progression are poorly understood to design new therapeutic interventions. In order to rapidly identify Chagas patients with a higher risk to develop CCM, a new set of biomarkers specific to Chagas disease is needed. We performed serum metabolomic analyses in chronic T. cruzi-infected mice fed on different diets and identified cardiac ventricular-specific metabolite biomarkers that could define CCM severity. In this paper, we present the results of serum metabolomic analyses and discuss its correlations to the diet-induced metabolic regulations in the pathogenesis of CCM in a murine model of Chagas disease.',\n",
              " 'ADAMTS-5 Decreases in Coronary Arteries and Plasma from Patients with Coronary Artery Disease\\n\\nThe current study demonstrates that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin type 1 motif- (ADAMTS-) 5 is a key extracellular matrix protease and associated with cardiovascular diseases. However, the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels and relevance of coronary artery disease (CAD) remain largely unknown. This study is aimed at examining the relationship between the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels and the severity of coronary stenosis in patients with CAD. In the present study, the expression of ADAMTS-5 was analyzed in coronary artery samples and blood. The results showed that the plasma ADAMTS-5 levels were lower in the CAD group than in the control group. In addition, significantly higher matrix metalloproteinase- (MMP-) 2 and MMP-9 levels were also observed in the patients with CAD, and the ADAMTS-5 levels were negatively correlated with the MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Spearman’s correlation analysis showed that the Gensini score was negatively correlated with the ADAMTS-5 levels but was positively correlated with the MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that ADAMTS-5, MMP-2, and MMP-9 may have a certain diagnostic value in CAD and that the combination of all three metalloproteinases had a higher diagnostic value. The findings provided a better understanding of the role of ADAMTS-5 in the diagnosis of CAD.',\n",

To investigate ultrasonographically the salivary glands and to correlate ultrasonographic parameters with focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and stimulated salivary flow rate. Material and Methods. 32 patients with primary Sjögren’s syndrome (pSS) and 32 healthy controls were enrolled in this case-control study, performed in the Department of Internal Medicine, Division of Rheumatology, “Victor Babeș” University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timișoara, Romania. All the patients and controls were examined by salivary gland ultrasonography (B-mode, color and spectral Doppler, and sonoelastography), determining the following parameters: salivary gland ultrasonography (SGUS) score, resistive index (RI) of transverse facial artery, and shear wave velocity (SWV). Serum beta-2-microglobulin and stimulated saliva amount were determined in all the patients and controls. Minor salivary gland biopsy with focus score assessment was done in pSS patients. Results. Patients with pSS presented higher SGUS score and parotid and submandibular SWV and reduced RI of transverse facial artery than controls (). In pSS patients, statistically significant correlations were identified between assessed ultrasonographic parameters and focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and respective stimulated saliva flow (). Conclusions. This study highlighted statistically significant correlations between salivary gland ultrasonographic parameters and focus score, serum beta-2-microglobulin, and stimulated saliva flow.',\n",
              " 'Favorable Response to CD34+ Cell Therapy Is Associated with a Decrease of Galectin-3 Levels in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure\\n\\nBackground. Galectin-3 plasma levels (gal-3) were shown to correlate with the scar burden in chronic heart failure (CHF) setting. As scar burden predicts response to stem cell therapy, we sought to explore a correlation between gal-3 and response to CD34+ cell transplantation in patients with CHF. Methods. We performed a post hoc analysis of patients, enrolled in 2 prospective trials investigating the clinical effects of CD34+ cell therapy in patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICMP) and nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCMP). CD34+ cells were mobilized by G-CSF, collected via apheresis, and injected transendocardially using NOGA system. Patients were followed for 3 months and demographic, echocardiographic, and biochemical parameters and gal-3 were analyzed at baseline and at follow-up. Response to cell therapy was defined as an LVEF increase of ≥5%. Results. 61 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 52 years and 83% were male. DCMP and ICMP were present in 69% and 31% of patients, respectively. The average serum creatinine was  μmol/L, NT-proBNP 1132 (IQR 350-2279) pg/mL, and LVEF %. Gal-3 at baseline and at 3 months did not differ significantly ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ), and there were no differences in baseline gal-3 with respect to heart failure etiology ( ng/mL in ICMP vs.  ng/mL in DCMP; ). Comparing responders () to nonresponders (), we found no differences in baseline gal-3 ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ). However, responders had significantly lower gal-3 at 3-month follow-up ( ng/mL vs.  ng/mL; ). Also, responders demonstrated a significant decrease in gal-3 over 3 months, while in nonresponders, an increase in gal-3 occurred ( ng/mL vs. ng/mL; ). Conclusions. In patients with chronic heart failure undergoing CD34+ cell therapy, a decrease in galectin-3 plasma levels is associated with beneficial response to this treatment modality. Further prospective data is warranted to confirm our findings and to deepen our understanding of the role of gal-3 in the field of stem cell therapy.',\n",
              " 'Circulating MicroRNAs as Novel Potential Biomarkers for Left Ventricular Remodeling in Postinfarction Heart Failure\\n\\nCirculating microRNAs (miRNAs) have been proposed as potential biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling in postinfarction heart failure (HF). However, the diagnostic reproducibility of the use of circulating miRNAs may be affected by the temporal expression of miRNAs following myocardial infarction (MI). In the current study, using a MI-induced HF rat cohort (4-, 8-, and 12-week post-MI groups), we investigated the temporal expression of plasma miRNAs during the development of left ventricular remodeling. The plasma miRNA expression profile was obtained using miRNA sequencing. The expression of candidate miRNAs in plasma and tissues was examined with real-time PCR. Target genes of candidate miRNAs were predicted using a parallel miRNA-messenger RNA expression profiling approach. The value of plasma miRNAs as biomarkers for left ventricular remodeling was evaluated in patients with postinfarction HF () and control patients with stable angina and without significant coronary lesions and HF () with real-time PCR. Although the expression levels of miR-20a-5p, miR-340-5p, and let-7i-5p were temporally regulated in plasma, myocardium, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells, the expression levels of plasma miRNAs, especially miR-20a-5p, were associated with the development of left ventricular remodeling in the postinfarction HF rat cohort. The target genes of these 3 miRNAs were associated with the mechanistic target of rapamycin, nuclear factor-κB, tumour necrosis factor, apoptosis, and p53 signaling pathways. Additionally, the plasma levels of miR-20a-5p, miR-340-5p, and let-7i-5p were significantly increased in patients with postinfarction HF. However, only the expression levels of miR-20a-5p presented significant positive correlations with left ventricular internal end diastolic dimension and left ventricular end diastolic volume. In conclusion, the expression levels of plasma miR-20a-5p were significantly associated with the degree of left ventricular dilatation, and plasma miR-20a-5p may be a potential biomarker for postinfarction left ventricular remodeling.',\n",
              " 'Cardiac Chagas Disease: MMPs, TIMPs, Galectins, and TGF-β as Tissue Remodelling Players\\n\\nA century after the discovery of Chagas disease, studies are still needed to establish the complex pathophysiology of this disease. However, it is known that several proteins and molecules are related to the establishment of this disease, its evolution, and the appearance of its different clinical forms. Metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, galectins, and TGF-β are involved in the process of infection and consequently the development of myocarditis, tissue remodeling, and fibrosis upon infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. Thus, considering that the heart is one of the main target organs in Chagas disease, knowledge regarding the mechanisms of action of these molecules is essential to understand how they interact and trigger local and systemic reactions and, consequently, determine whether they contribute to the development of Chagas’ heart disease. In this sense, it is believed that the inflammatory microenvironment caused by the infection alters the expression of these proteins favoring progression of the host-parasite cycle and thereby stimulating cardiac tissue remodeling mechanisms and fibrosis. The aim of this review was to gather information on metalloproteinases and their tissue inhibitors, galectins, and TGF-β and discuss how these molecules and their different interrelationships contribute to the development of Chagas’ heart disease.',\n",
              " 'The Crucial Role of CXCL8 and Its Receptors in Colorectal Liver Metastasis\\n\\nCXCL8 (also known as IL-8) can produce different biological effects by binding to its receptors: CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). CXCL8 and its receptors are associated with the development of various tumor types, especially colorectal cancer and its liver metastases. In addition to promoting angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, migration, and the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, CXCL8 and its receptors have also been known to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells, to help them to escape host immunosurveillance as well as to enhance resistance to anoikis, which promotes the formation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and their colonization of distant organs. In this paper, we will review the established roles of CXCL8 signaling in CRC and discuss the possible strategies of targeting CXCL8 signaling for overcoming CRC drug resistance and cancer progression, including direct targeting of CXCL8/CXCR1/2 or indirect targeting through the inhibition of CXCL8-CXCR1/2 signaling.',\n",
              " 'Urinary Matrix Metalloproteinase-7 and Prediction of AKI Progression Post Cardiac Surgery\\n\\nAims. Early detection of patients at high risk for progressive acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery remains a major challenge. We aim to evaluate the utility of urinary matrix metalloproteinase-7 (uMMP-7) and other reported biomarkers for predicting AKI progression during postoperative hospital stay. Methods. We conducted a prospective, multicenter cohort study in 121 adult patients with stage 1 or 2 AKI after cardiac surgery. uMMP-7 and other well-reported biomarkers (uIL-18, uNGAL, and UACR) were measured at time of AKI clinical diagnosis. The primary outcome is the progression of AKI after cardiac surgery, defined as worsening of AKI stage (stage 1 to either stage 2 or stage 3 or from stage 2 to stage 3). Results. A level of  at time of AKI diagnosis conveyed an 8-fold risk of AKI progression as compared to those with  after adjusting for clinical risk factors. The performance of uMMP-7 for predicting progressive AKI was good with an AUC of 0.80. The combination of uMMP-7 and IL-18 produces the greatest AUC for predicting progressive AKI. Addition of uMMP-7 to the clinical risk factor model significantly improved risk reclassification for AKI progression. Conclusions. uMMP-7, measured at time of AKI clinical diagnosis, is a novel biomarker for predicting the progression of AKI after cardiac surgery. Adding uMMP-7 to the clinical risk factor model may be used as a noninvasive approach to identify a subpopulation that is at high risk for progressive AKI after cardiac surgery.',\n",
              " 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Pregnancy with Intrauterine Growth Restriction: A Pilot Study\\n\\nObjective. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a major cause of late stillbirth, though not all compromised babies remain small or are considered growth restricted as pregnancy progresses. Fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (f-MRI) represents a second-line tool to study pregnancies with IUGR fetuses. The aim of our study was to evaluate the usefulness of f-MRI on predicting fetal growth and the offspring’s perinatal respiratory outcome. Design. All f-MRI performed between 2014 and 2016 in Siena were analysed. Pregnancies with IUGR (Study group (SG)) were recruited together with a control population (Control group (CG)), coupled for gestational age (GA) at the time of f-MRI (mean GA 31 wks). Neonatal information was collected. The f-MRI protocol consisted of T2w images. Six regions of interest (ROI) were placed as follows: 2 on the lung, 2 on the liver, and 2 on the amniotic fluid. The signal intensities (SI) of each ROI were measured. The SI lung to liver ratio (SI lung/liver) and SI lung to amniotic fluid ratio (SI lung/amniotic fluid) were obtained for each fetus. Each ratio was compared between SG and CG. Therefore, SG was divided into two subgroups: adequate and small for gestational age (AGA and SGA) newborns. All measurements were related to offspring’s perinatal respiratory outcome. Results. SI lung/liver was linearly related with GA at the time of f-MRI and with EFW. SI lung/amniotic fluid was significantly higher in SG than in CG (). In contrast, among SG, lower values of SI lung/amniotic fluid were found in the SGA compared to AGA (). The days of oxygen supply were higher in the SGA subgroup than in the AGA subgroup (). Conclusions. SI lung/liver increases with fetal lung maturation and appears to be useful to estimate intrauterine fetal growth. SI lung/amniotic fluid seems to be a reliable predictive index to distinguish the IUGR fetuses that can recover their growth from those that were born SGA. f-MRI represents a promising frontier to predict IUGR fetus outcome, thus contributing to ameliorate the perinatal management.',\n",
              " 'Prognostic Value of MicroRNAs in Patients after Myocardial Infarction: A Substudy of PRAGUE-18\\n\\nBackground. The evaluation of the long-term risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and cardiac death in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is an established clinical process. Laboratory markers may significantly help with the risk stratification of these patients. Our objective was to find the relation of selected microRNAs to the standard markers of AMI and determine if these microRNAs can be used to identify patients at increased risk. Methods. Selected microRNAs (miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499) were measured in a cohort of 122 patients from the PRAGUE-18 study (ticagrelor vs. prasugrel in AMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI)). The cohort was split into two subgroups: 116 patients who did not die (survivors) and 6 patients who died (nonsurvivors) during the 365-day period after AMI. Plasma levels of selected circulating miRNAs were then assessed in combination with high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hsTnT) and N-terminal probrain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP). Results. miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 correlated positively with NT-proBNP and hsTnT 24 hours after admission and negatively with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Both miR-1 and miR-133a positively correlated with hsTnT at admission. Median relative levels of all selected miRNAs were higher in the subgroup of nonsurvivors () in comparison with survivors (), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. All patients in the nonsurvivor subgroup had miR-499 and NT-proBNP levels above the cut-off values (891.5\\u2009ng/L for NT-proBNP and 0.088 for miR-499), whereas in the survivor subgroup, only 28.4% of patients were above the cut-off values (). Conclusions. Statistically significant correlation was found between miR-1, miR-133a, and miR-499 and hsTnT, NT-proBNP, and LVEF. In addition, this analysis suggests that plasma levels of circulating miR-499 could contribute to the identification of patients at increased risk of death during the first year after AMI, especially when combined with NT-proBNP levels.',\n",
              " 'Long Noncoding RNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, SMILR, and MALAT1 in Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: Validation of Biomarkers in Clinical Samples\\n\\nBackground and Objectives. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) is a silent disease characterised by aortic wall expansion and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dedifferentiation from contractile to synthetic phenotype. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) involved in VSMC phenotypic regulation could be considered as potential diagnostic indicators and therapeutic targets of TAA. In vitro studies show that lncRNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, MALAT1, and SMILR are associated with the VSMC phenotypic state. Our aim was to test if these lncRNAs are dysregulated during TAA formation in clinical patient samples. Materials and Methods. Relative expression of lncRNAs CARMN, LUCAT1, SMILR, and MALAT1 was tested in clinical aortic tissue and blood plasma samples from TAA and non-TAA patients using the qRT-PCR method. The Mann–Whitney  test was used to compare ΔCt values between the study groups. ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of plasma lncRNAs. Results. We found significantly reduced CARMN () and LUCAT1 () expression in aortic tissue samples from TAA patients. Relative expression of MALAT1 () and SMILR () did not differ in aortic tissue between the TAA and non-TAA groups. Expression of both LUCAT1 and SMILR was significantly decreased in TAA patients’ blood plasma compared to controls ( and , respectively). However, only LUCAT1 showed the ability to discriminate aneurysmal disease in patients’ blood plasma (, , ). Conclusions. We have shown that the expression of lncRNAs CARMN and LUCAT1 is reduced in dilated aortic tissue and that the LUCAT1 and SMILR expression is lower in the blood plasma of TAA patients. Decreased LUCAT1 expression in TAA patients’ blood plasma may have diagnostic potential in discriminating patients with TAA.',\n",
              " 'Association of Plasma Renalase and Left Ventricle Mass Index in Heart Failure Patients Stratified to the Category of the Ejection Fraction: A Pilot Study\\n\\nHeart failure represents a growing health problem, with increasing morbidity and mortality globally. According to the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of heart failure, many biomarkers have been proposed for the timely diagnosis and prognostication of patients with heart failure, but other than natriuretic peptides, none of them has gained enough clinical significance. Renalase, a new protein derived from kidneys was demonstrated to metabolize catecholamines and to have a cardioprotective role. The aim of the study was to determine whether renalase and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentration could be used to differentiate heart failure patients stratified to the category of the ejection fraction and whether plasma renalase could be used as a biomarker for left ventricle hypertrophy in all subgroups of heart failure patients. We included patients diagnosed with heart failure and stratified them to the three subgroups according to the ejection fraction. Regarding echocardiographic parameters, HFmrEF had an intermediate profile in between HFrEF and HFpEF, with statistical significance in most evaluated parameters. BNP concentration was significantly different in all three subgroups (), and renalase was statistically higher in HFrEF () compared to the HFmrEF and HFpEF, where its results were similar, without statistical significance. Renalase plasma concentration was demonstrated to be highly and positively associated with left ventricle mass index in HFrEF (), as well as increased plasma concentration of BNP (). In the HFmrEF group of patients, body mass index was positively associated with LVMI (), while in the patients with HFpEF, diabetes mellitus was demonstrated to have a positive association with LVMI (). These findings suggest that renalase concentration may be measured in order to differentiate patients with reduced ejection fraction. Plasma renalase concentrations positively correlated with left ventricle hypertrophy in patients with reduced ejection fraction, being strongly associated with increased left ventricular mass index.',\n",
              " 'Vitamin D Deficiency Predicts Poor Clinical Outcomes in Heart Failure Patients Undergoing Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy\\n\\nBackground and Aims. Resynchronization therapy (CRT) improves mortality and induces reverse remodeling in heart failure (HF) patients with reduced ejection fraction and wide QRS. Nonetheless, some patients do not improve despite the optimal medical therapy and right indications for device implantation. Therefore, finding biomarkers suitable for identification of those patients is crucial. Vitamin D plays a classic hormonal role in the regulation of bone metabolism and also has physiological functions in wide range of nonskeletal tissues. Based on recent studies, low levels of vitamin D seem to directly contribute to pathogenesis and worsening of HF. We planned to assess the role of vitamin D levels on clinical outcomes of HF patients undergoing CRT. Methods and Results. We enrolled 136 HF patients undergoing CRT. Total plasma vitamin D levels were measured at baseline and 6 months later. Primary endpoint was 5-year all-cause mortality; secondary endpoint was lack of good clinical response, defined as less than 15% increase of left ventricular ejection fraction after six months. During follow-up, 58 patients reached the primary, and 45 patients reached the secondary endpoint. Vitamin D levels less than 24.13\\u2009ng/mL predicted 5-year mortality () and poor clinical response () after adjusting to all significant baseline predictors. Conclusion. Our study showed that vitamin D deficiency has a significant impact in heart failure patients; it is an independent predictor of lack of midterm clinical response and long-term mortality in patients undergoing CRT. Therefore, monitoring vitamin D status of heart failure patients could be of clinical significance.',\n",
              " 'Association of Galectin-3 and Soluble ST2, and Their Changes, with Echocardiographic Parameters and Development of Heart Failure after ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction\\n\\nPurpose. To investigate the association of galectin-3 (Gal-3) and soluble ST2 (sST2) and their follow-up changes with the development of heart failure (HF) and echocardiographic parameters of HF (ejection fraction, atrial and ventricular size, left ventricular hypertrophy, e, and E/e) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). Methods. A prospective, observational study, BIOSTRAT (Biomarkers for Risk Stratification After STEMI), enrolled 117 patients between October 2014 and April 2017. Gal-3 and sST2 serum collection and echocardiography were performed twice (during index hospitalization and on a control visit at one-year follow-up). The primary endpoint was HF onset at one-year follow-up. Secondary assessments included associations of biomarker concentration with echocardiographic indices of systolic and diastolic dysfunction at baseline and at one year. Results. Mean baseline concentrations of Gal-3 and sST2 (7.5 and 26.4\\u2009ng/mL, respectively) were significantly increased at one-year follow-up (8.5\\u2009ng/mL and  and 31.4\\u2009ng/mL and , respectively). Patients who reached the primary endpoint (50 patients (48%)) had significantly higher baseline concentrations of both biomarkers and a higher Gal-3 level at one year compared to patients who did not. Both Gal-3 and sST2 were predictors of the primary endpoint in univariate logistic regression analysis, but only Gal-3 remained significant in multivariate analysis. There was no clear association between both biomarkers and echocardiographic parameters. Conclusions. Baseline, but not one-year, changes of Gal-3 and sST2 concentrations may be useful for risk stratification after STEMI. However, only Gal-3 was the independent predictor of HF development at one-year observation. This trial is registered with NCT03735719.',\n",

Mineral bone disorders (MBDs) constitute a hallmark of CKD, and alongside cardiovascular complications, they underlie a poor prognosis for these patients. Thus, our study focused on novel CKD biomarker patterns and their impact on the clinical staging of the disease. As a first testing approach, the relative expression levels of 105 proteins were assessed by the Proteome Profiler Cytokine Array Kit for pooled CKD stage 2–4 serum samples to establish an overall view regarding the proteins involved in CKD pathogenesis. Among the molecules that displayed significant dysregulation in the CKD stages, we further explored the involvement of Dickkopf-related protein 1 (Dkk-1), a recognised inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway, and its crosstalk with 1,25OH2D3 (calcitriol) as new players in renal bone and vascular disease. The serum levels of these two molecules were quantified by an ELISA (76 samples), and the results reveal decreasing circulating levels of Dkk-1 and calcitriol in advanced CKD stages, with their circulating expression showing a downward trend as the CKD develops. In the next step, we analysed the inflammation and MBD biomarkers’ expression in CKD (by xMAP array). Our results show that the molecules involved in orchestrating the inflammatory response, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), as well as the mineral biomarkers osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), osteopontin (OPN), and fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), correlate with Dkk-1 and calcitriol, raising the possibility of them being potential useful CKD biomarkers. These results reveal the impact of different biomarker patterns in CKD staging and severity, thus opening up novel approaches to be explored in CKD clinical management.',\n",
              " 'Gas6/TAM Signaling Components as Novel Biomarkers of Liver Fibrosis\\n\\nLiver fibrosis consists in the accumulation of extracellular matrix components mainly derived from activated hepatic stellate cells. This is commonly the result of chronic liver injury repair and represents an important health concern. As liver biopsy is burdened with many drawbacks, not surprisingly there is great interest to find new reliable noninvasive methods. Among the many are new potential fibrosis biomarkers under study, some of the most promising represented by the growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6) serum protein and its family of tyrosine kinase receptors, namely, Tyro3, Axl, and MERTK (TAM). Gas6/TAM system (mainly, Axl and MERTK) has in fact recently emerged as an important player in the progression of liver fibrosis. This review is aimed at giving an overall perspective of the roles played by these molecules in major chronic liver diseases. The most promising findings up to date acknowledge that both Gas6 and its receptor serum levels (such as sAxl and, probably, sMERTK) have been shown to potentially allow for easy and accurate measurement of hepatic fibrosis progression, also providing indicative parameters of hepatic dysfunction. Although most of the current scientific evidence is still preliminary and there are no in vivo validation studies on large patient series, it still looks very promising to imagine a possible future prognostic role for these biomarkers in the multidimensional assessment of a liver patient. One may also speculate on a potential role for this system targeting (e.g., with small molecule inhibitors against Axl) as a therapeutic strategy for liver fibrosis management, always bearing in mind that any such therapeutic approach might face toxicity.',\n",
              " 'Ratio of Early Mitral Inflow Velocity to the Global Diastolic Strain Rate and Global Left Ventricular Longitudinal Systolic Strain Predict Overall Mortality and Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Hemodialysis Patients\\n\\nBackground. The ratio of early mitral inflow velocity to the global diastolic strain rate (E/E’sr) and global longitudinal systolic strain (GLS) of the left ventricle (LV) are emerging indices of diastolic and systolic functions, respectively, for the LV. Their prognostic significance in the prediction of mortality and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes remains underexplored in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Methods. This prospective study included 190 maintenance HD patients. The E/E’sr ratio and GLS were assessed using two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography. The clinical outcomes included overall mortality, CV mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). The associations between the E/E’sr ratio, GLS, and clinical outcomes were evaluated using multivariate Cox regression analysis. The incremental values of the E/E’sr ratio and GLS in outcome prediction were assessed by  changes in Cox models. Results. Over a median follow-up period of 3.7 years, there were 35 overall deaths, 16 CV deaths, and 45 MACE. Impaired diastolic function with a higher E/E’sr ratio was associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.484; 95% CI, 1.201−1.834; ), CV mortality (HR, 1.584; 95% CI, 1.058–2.371; ), and MACE (HR, 1.205; 95% CI, 1.040−1.397; ) in multivariate adjusted Cox analysis. Worsening GLS was associated with overall mortality (HR, 1.276; 95% CI, 1.101−1.480; ), CV mortality (HR, 1.513; 95% CI, 1.088−2.104; ), and MACE (HR, 1.214; 95% CI, 1.103−1.337; ). The E/E’sr ratio and GLS had better outcome prediction than the E to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/E’) ratio and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). Moreover, adding the E/E’sr ratio and GLS to Cox models containing relevant clinical and conventional echocardiographic parameters improved the prediction of overall mortality (), CV mortality (), and MACE (). Conclusion. The E/E’sr ratio and GLS, as emerging indices of LV diastolic and systolic functions, significantly predict mortality and CV outcomes and outperform conventional echocardiographic parameters in outcome prediction in HD patients.',\n",
              " 'Bone Mineral Density as a Predictor of Atherogenic Indexes of Cardiovascular Disease, Especially in Nonobese Adults\\n\\nPurpose. This study is aimed at determining whether bone mineral density (BMD) values are related to atherogenic indexes (AIs) and could predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in southern Taiwanese adults. Methods. Medical records of 3249 adults who underwent health examinations between June 2014 and February 2018 at a regional hospital in southern Taiwan were reviewed. Data collected included health history, anthropomorphic characteristics, exercise habits, diets (vegetarian or nonvegetarian), clinical laboratory results (lipid profile, systemic blood pressure (SBP), glucose level, creatinine (Cre) level, and hemoglobin (Hb) level), and bone mineral density (BMD), which were used to identify the associations of these parameters, especially BMD, with lipid profile and calculated AIs through simple and multiple linear regressions. Results. The mean age of the patients was 58.0 years, and 71.4% were male. Body mass index (BMI), SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, and all BMD values were positively correlated with triglyceride (TG) level and AIs and were negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level. The significant positive correlations of BMD at all the measured sites with AIs remained after adjusting for age, sex, SBP, glucose level, Cre level, Hb level, smoking, exercise habits, and vegetarian state. The expanded adjusting model for TG/HDL-C remained significant at all the BMD measured sites in nonobese men, at bilateral femoral neck and total hips in nonobese women, and at the bilateral total hips in obese women. Conclusions. AIs are predictive markers for CVD, and BMD values are predictors of AIs, especially the novel AI, i.e., TG/HDL-C ratio, in nonobese adult men and women after dividing the patients into subgroups to eliminate the effect of BMI as a confounding factor. Thus, BMD values could predict AIs of CVD, especially in nonobese adults.',\n",
              " 'Proteomic Comparison of Malignant Human Germ Cell Tumor Cell Lines\\n\\nMalignant germ cell tumors (GCT) are the most common malignant tumors in young men between 18 and 40 years. The correct identification of histological subtypes, in difficult cases supported by immunohistochemistry, is essential for therapeutic management. Furthermore, biomarkers may help to understand pathophysiological processes in these tumor types. Two GCT cell lines, TCam-2 with seminoma-like characteristics, and NTERA-2, an embryonal carcinoma-like cell line, were compared by a quantitative proteomic approach using high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) in combination with stable isotope labelling by amino acid in cell culture (SILAC). We were able to identify 4856 proteins and quantify the expression of 3936. 347 were significantly differentially expressed between the two cell lines. For further validation, CD81, CBX-3, PHF6, and ENSA were analyzed by western blot analysis. The results confirmed the MS results. Immunohistochemical analysis on 59 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) normal and GCT tissue samples (normal testis, GCNIS, seminomas, and embryonal carcinomas) of these proteins demonstrated the ability to distinguish different GCT subtypes, especially seminomas and embryonal carcinomas. In addition, siRNA-mediated knockdown of these proteins resulted in an antiproliferative effect in TCam-2, NTERA-2, and an additional embryonal carcinoma-like cell line, NCCIT. In summary, this study represents a proteomic resource for the discrimination of malignant germ cell tumor subtypes and the observed antiproliferative effect after knockdown of selected proteins paves the way for the identification of new potential drug targets.',\n",
              " 'Identification of Core Gene Biomarkers in Patients with Diabetic Cardiomyopathy\\n\\nDiabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disorder of the myocardium in diabetic patients, which is one of the critical complications of diabetes giving rise to an increased mortality. However, the underlying mechanisms of DCM remain incompletely understood presently. This study was designed to screen the potential molecules and pathways implicated with DCM. GSE26887 involving 5 control individuals and 7 DCM patients was selected from the GEO database to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). DAVID was applied to perform gene ontology (GO) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was also constructed to visualize the interactions among these DEGs. To further validate significant genes and pathways, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blot were performed. A total of 236 DEGs were captured, including 134 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes. GO, KEGG, and the PPI network disclosed that inflammation, immune disorders, metabolic disturbance, and mitochondrial dysfunction were significantly enriched in the development of DCM. Notably, IL6 was an upregulated hub gene with the highest connectivity degree, suggesting that it may interact with a great many molecules and pathways. Meanwhile, SOCS3 was also one of the top 15 hub genes in the PPI network. Herein, we detected the protein level of STAT3 and SOCS3 in a mouse model with DCM. Western blot results showed that the protein level of SOCS3 was significantly lower while phosphorylated-STAT3 (P-STAT3) was activated in mice with DCM. In vitro results also uncovered the similar alterations of SOCS3 and P-STAT3 in cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts induced by high glucose (HG). However, overexpression of SOCS3 could significantly reverse HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen synthesis of cardiac fibroblasts. Taken together, our analysis unveiled potential biomarkers and molecular mechanisms in DCM, which could be helpful to the diagnosis and treatment of DCM.',\n",
              " 'Evaluation of a Novel Missense Mutation in ABCB4 Gene Causing Progressive Familial Intrahepatic Cholestasis Type 3\\n\\nProgressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 (PFIC3) is a hepatic disorder occurring predominantly in childhood and is difficult to diagnose. PFIC3, being a rare autosomal recessive disease, is caused by genetic mutations in both alleles of ABCB4, resulting in the disruption of the bile secretory pathway. The identification of pathogenic effects resulting from different mutations in ABCB4 is the key to revealing the internal cause of disease. These mutations cause truncation, instability, misfolding, and impaired trafficking of the MDR3 protein. Here, we reported a girl, with a history of intrahepatic cholestasis and progressive liver cirrhosis, with an elevated gamma-glutamyltransferase level. Genetic screening via whole exome sequencing found a novel homozygous missense mutation ABCB4:c.1195G>C:p.V399L, and the patient was diagnosed with PFIC3. Various computational tools predicted the variant to be deleterious and evolutionary conserved. For functional characterization studies, plasmids, encoding ABCB4 wild-type and selected established mutant constructs, were expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) cells. In vitro expression analysis observed a reduced expression of mutant protein compared to wild-type protein. We found that ABCB4 wild type was localized at the apical canalicular membrane, while mutant p.V399L showed intracellular retention. Intracellular mistrafficking proteins usually undergo proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. We found that after treatment with proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin A1, MDR3 expression of V399L was significantly increased. A decrease in MDR3 expression of mutant V399L protein may be a result of proteasomal or lysosomal degradation. Pharmacological modulator cyclosporin A and intracellular low temperature (30°C) treatment significantly rescued both the folding defect and the active maturation of the mutant protein. Our study identified a novel pathogenic mutation which expanded the mutational spectrum of the ABCB4 gene and may contribute to understanding the molecular basis of PFIC3. Therefore, genetic screening plays a conclusive role in the diagnosis of rare heterogenic disorders like PFIC3.',\n",
              " 'Targeting mTOR in Glioblastoma: Rationale and Preclinical/Clinical Evidence\\n\\nThe mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) drives several physiologic and pathologic cellular processes and is frequently deregulated in different types of tumors, including glioblastoma (GBM). Despite recent advancements in understanding the molecular mechanisms involved in GBM biology, the survival rates of this tumor are still disappointing, primarily due to the lack of efficacious treatments. The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR pathway has emerged as a crucial player in GBM development and progression. However, to date, all the attempts to target this pathway with PI3K, AKT, or mTORC1 inhibitors failed to improve the outcome of patients with GBM. Despite these discouraging results, recent evidence pointed out that the blockade of mTORC2 might provide a useful therapeutic strategy for GBM, with the potential to overcome the limitations that mTORC1 inhibitors have shown so far. In this review, we analyzed the rationale of targeting mTOR in GBM and the available preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the choice of this therapeutic approach, highlighting the different roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in GBM biology.',\n",
              " 'Combination of Proteasome and Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors Overcomes the Impact of Gain-of-Function p53 Mutations\\n\\nMutations in the “guardian of the genome” TP53 predominate in solid tumors. In addition to loss of tumor suppressor activity, a specific subset of missense mutations confers additional oncogenic properties. These “gain-of-function” (GOF) mutations portend poor prognosis across cancer types regardless of treatment. Our objective in this study was to identify novel therapeutic opportunities to overcome the deleterious effects of GOF TP53 mutants. Using gynecologic cancer cell lines with known TP53 mutational status, we established that treatment with a proteasome inhibitor induced cell death in cells with two recurrent GOF TP53 mutations (R175H and R248Q), and addition of a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) enhanced this effect. By contrast, p53-null cancer cells were relatively resistant to the combination. Proteasome inhibition promoted apoptosis of cells with TP53 GOF mutations, potentially through induction of the unfolded protein response. In line with the reported hyperstabilization of GOF p53 protein, cells treated with HDACi exhibited reduced levels of p53 protein. Together, these data form the basis for future clinical studies examining therapeutic efficacy in a preselected patient population with GOF TP53 mutations.',\n",

The aim of the present study was to establish associations of salivary potassium, sodium, calcium, and phosphate levels with the cardiovascular phenotype determined by carotid ultrasound and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity and to identify possible covariates for these associations.  samples of nonstimulated whole buccal saliva were obtained from subjects with (; 59%) or without (; 41%) hypertension. The potassium concentrations were 10-fold higher in saliva compared with plasma, whereas sodium concentrations exhibited the reverse relation between saliva and blood. There were no significant correlations between the levels of sodium, potassium, or calcium in saliva and plasma. All salivary electrolytes, except sodium, were significantly associated with age. In age-adjusted analyses, salivary potassium was significantly associated with carotid artery intima media thickness (cIMT) and carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and these associations were at the limit of significance in multivariate analyses including prevalent cardiovascular disease and risk factors. Body mass index was a significant confounder for salivary potassium. Salivary phosphate was significantly associated with cIMT in the multivariate analysis. Salivary potassium, calcium, and phosphate levels were significantly associated with heart rate in the univariate age-adjusted as well as in two different multivariate models, whereas no significant associations between sodium and heart rate were observed. In conclusion, the differential association of salivary electrolytes with cardiovascular phenotypes indicates that these electrolytes should be further studied for their predictive value as noninvasive biomarkers for cardiovascular risk evaluation.',\n",

Thus, much more efforts in terms of diagnostics and treatments must be provided in the fight of these outcomes. In this sense, recently, the study of saliva as biological matrix has been identified as a new landmark initiative in the search of novel and useful biomarkers to prevent and diagnose these conditions. Specifically, saliva is a rich reservoir of different proteins and peptides and accessible due to recent advances in molecular biology and specially in targeted and unbiased proteomics technologies. Nonetheless, emerging barriers are an obstacle to the study of the salivary proteome in an effective way. This review aims at giving an overall perspective of salivary biomarkers identified in several oral diseases by means of molecular biology approaches.',\n",

Periodontal disease is prevalent and has an inflammation associated with not only oral but also systemic pathologies. The diagnosis by biomarkers is required for clinical practice on periodontal disease. The lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin were both inflammation-related molecules. The present study investigated the relationship between the periodontal status and the two biomarkers in gingival retention fluid (GRF). Patients and Methods. In 63 subjects with periodontitis, the GRF was sampled from maxillary anterior gingiva using a microbrush for 30 seconds. The lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin levels in GRF were measured by an enzyme-link solvent immunoassay. Periodontal status was evaluated by probing pocket depth (PD) and bleeding on probing (BOP). Results. There was a higher level of these biomarkers in saliva (median (ng/mL), lactoferrin: 3611.9, α1-antitrypsin: 4573.3) than in GRF (lactoferrin: 61.0, α1-antitrypsin: 54.7). There was a mild-to-moderate but significantly positive correlation in lactoferrin or α1-antitrypsin between GRF and saliva. There was a positively mild-to-moderate accuracy (area under the curve: 0.60–0.81) of lactoferrin or α1-antitrypsin in GRF or in saliva to distinguish the severity of periodontal status. The cutoff level (ng/mL) of lactoferrin in GRF for detecting ≥30% of PD\\u2009≥\\u20094\\u2009mm (moderate periodontitis) was 68.6 and for detecting ≥20% of BOP (clinically active periodontitis) was 61.2. The cutoff level (ng/mL) of α1-antitrypsin in GRF for detecting ≥30% of PD\\u2009≥\\u20094\\u2009mm was 54.5 and for detecting ≥20% of BOP was 35.3. Conclusions. The data can promote an application of the measurements of lactoferrin and α1-antitrypsin in GRF to clinical practice on periodontal disease.',\n",
              " 'Usefulness of the Adipokines as Biomarkers of Ischemic Cardiac Dysfunction\\n\\nCardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among both women and men, but there is still a great percentage of misdiagnosis and lack of clearly defined criteria. Advances in biomolecular science have proven the crucial role of inflammation and, more importantly, the role of adipokines in mediating all stages of coronary artery disease. It has also been suggested that regional fat deposits, more precisely from thoracic region, have a major influence on the development of coronary artery disease by creating a local proatherogenic environment. The immune system closely interacts with metabolic risk factors to initiate, promote, and further aggravate the atherosclerotic lesions on the arterial wall all with the “help” of adipokines. So nowadays, research extensively focuses on uncovering biomarkers that would provide an increased chance of detecting subclinical cardiac distress and also add a consistent value to current guideline-imposed risk criteria.',\n",
              " 'Adipokines as Biomarkers in Health and Disease\\n\\nAdipokines are important circulating factors mediating intertissue crosstalk throughout the body and thus playing a key role in maintaining endocrine homeostasis. So far, multiple associations of adipokines with widespread noncommunicable diseases, including cardiometabolic diseases, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, and fertility problems, have been identified. However, the precise mechanisms underlying empirically observed associations are still rather poorly understood, and more research must be carried out in order to make sense of and deepen the already published data.\\n\\nA better understanding of associations of adipokine expression and common diseases seems warranted, and the journal set out to publish this special issue. The preparation of this special issue resulted in a series of 5 articles, submitted by researchers from Kuwait, Czech Republic, Germany, and China. All the published studies were approved by the local Ethical Committees, and the statements are included in the Method section of the respective papers.\\n\\nFirst, T. Pavlova et al. (Czech Republic), in their work titled “Irisin Maternal Plasma and Cord Blood Levels in Mothers with Spontaneous Preterm and Term Delivery,” focused on the possible association of irisin levels—a protective exercise-induced myokine—with preterm birth and concluded that irisin levels in cord blood were significantly different between preterm and term pregnancies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study ever to report the association of irisin cord blood levels with preterm birth.\\n\\nSecond, A. Koch et al. (Germany) in their work titled “Visfatin Serum Levels Predict Mortality in Critically Ill Patients” focused on the potential of visfatin to predict mortality of critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU). Visfatin is an adipokine also called nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which displays insulin-mimicking effects. The authors report that the visfatin serum concentrations were strongly associated with disease severity and organ failure, irrespectively of the possible presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Moreover, the authors observed that visfatin levels correlated with biomarkers of renal failure, liver dysfunction, and other adipokines (e.g., resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in their cohort. Last but not least, high visfatin levels at ICU admission were predictive of an increased mortality, both at the ICU and during a long-term follow-up of approximately two years. Such findings emphasize strongly the need for a replication study of the potential of visfatin for the prediction of organ failure and/or overall survival in ICU patients.\\n\\nLastly, three papers focused on the possible associations of specific adipokines with insulin sensitivity or T2DM with or without concomitant metabolic syndrome: (i) F. Wang et al. from China (manuscript titled “Circulating PGRN Levels Are Increased but Not Associated with Insulin Sensitivity or β-Cell Function in Chinese Obese Children”) investigated the association of progranulin with insulin sensitivity or β-cell function in a Chinese paediatric cohort, (ii) N. A. Abdella and O. A. Mojiminiyi from Kuwait (manuscript titled “Clinical Applications of Adiponectin Measurements in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Screening, Diagnosis, and Marker of Diabetes Control”) focused on adiponectin as a potential diagnostic marker for T2DM or insulin resistance, and (iii) P. Yan et al. from China (manuscript titled “Plasma Neuregulin 4 Levels Are Associated with Metabolic Syndrome in Patients Newly Diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus”) investigated the link between neuregulin 4 and metabolic syndrome in newly diagnosed T2DM patients. Each of these works provides unique insights into the field, suggesting, respectively, that (i) progranulin is associated with higher BMI and multiple parameters of obesity in obese children, (ii) adiponectin may be useful as possible diagnostic/therapeutic markers in T2DM, and (iii) neuregulin 4 is associated with parameters of metabolic syndrome in newly diagnosed T2DM patients.\\n\\nTaken together, the presented papers further emphasize the complexity of the adipokine network that likely serves as master relays for integrating the influences of environmental factors with the genetic and epigenetic makeup of every individual. All the included papers further highlight the importance of larger prospective studies as well as validation studies on different populations of patients and different ethnicities. To conclude, the presented special issue provides a collection of novel findings in the field, contributing possibly to better decision-making in the clinical practice. It should be kept in mind, however, that adipokines are part of large neuroendocrine-immune-metabolic networks, and they exert their effects through complex endocrine, paracrine, autocrine, or juxtacrine crosstalk mechanisms, which should be further investigated with system medicine approaches.',\n",

Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is a frequent complication limiting the long-term (>1 year) survival after heart transplantation (HTx). CAV is initiated by endothelial dysfunction and can lead to severe cardiovascular (CV) complications. Since CAV is often clinically silent, biomarkers could help identifying HTx patients at risk of CAV and their severe complications. Aim. Evaluate the clinical yield of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), marker of cardiomyocyte damage, and the soluble form of AXL (sAXL), biomarker of endothelial dysfunction, to assess the prognosis of long-term cardiovascular (CV) events occurring after HTx. Methods. 96 patients were evaluated at least\\u2009>\\u20091 year after HTx. CAV was evaluated by coronary angiography or multisliced tomography, and hs-cTnT and sAXL measured 6 months before or after CAV evaluation. Patients were followed during 42\\u2009±\\u200915 months for a combined end point including cardiac death, angina or acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular ejection fraction\\u2009<\\u200950%, or heart failure not due to an acute rejection. Results. 51 patients (53%) presented CAV at evaluation; 21 of them had CV events. Hs-cTnT (56\\u2009±\\u200945 versus 20\\u2009±\\u200918\\u2009ng/L; ) and sAXL concentrations (98\\u2009±\\u200951 versus 26\\u2009±\\u200926\\u2009ng/L; ) were significantly higher in patients with CV events. Hs-cTnT (HR 1.03; 95% CI 1.015–1.042, ) and sAXL (HR 1.01; 95% CI 1.001–1.019, ) were independent predictors of CV events. A hs-cTnT concentration\\u2009<\\u200921\\u2009ng/L, detected by AUC ROC, predicted the absence of CV events with a predictive value of 91%; sAXL did not add more predictive value to hs-cTnT.

Procalcitonin (PCT) is an excellent marker of sepsis but was not extensively studied in cardiology. The present study investigated PCT plasma concentration in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and its prognostic value during 24-month follow-up. Material and Methods. Study group consisted of 130 patients with HFrEF (LVEF\\u2009≤\\u200945%) and 32 controls. PCT level was assessed on admission in all patients. Telephone follow-up was performed every three months over a period of 2 years. Endpoints were death of all causes and readmission for HFrEF exacerbation. Results. HFrEF patients had significantly higher PCT concentration than controls (166.95 versus 22.15\\u2009pg/ml; ). Individuals with peripheral oedema had increased PCT comparing to those without oedema (217.07 versus 152.12\\u2009pg/ml; ). In ROC analysis, PCT turned out to be a valuable diagnostic marker of HFrEF (AUC 0.91; ). Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that patients with PCT in the 4th quartile had significantly lower probability of survival than those with PCT in the 1st and 2nd quartiles. In univariate, but not multivariate, analysis, procalcitonin turned out to be a significant predictor of death during 24-month follow-up. (; 95% CI 1.000–1.003; ). Conclusions. Elevated PCT concentration may serve as another predictor of worse outcome in patients with HFrEF.',\n",
              " 'Visfatin Serum Levels Predict Mortality in Critically Ill Patients\\n\\nThe adipokine visfatin, also termed pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor (PBEF), is mainly derived from adipose tissue but has been implicated in the regulation of innate immune responses. We hypothesized that visfatin could be a potential circulating biomarker in critical illness and sepsis. We therefore measured serum levels of visfatin in a cohort of 229 critically ill medical patients upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). In comparison to 53 healthy controls, visfatin levels were significantly elevated in medical ICU patients, especially in patients with sepsis. Visfatin serum concentrations were strongly associated with disease severity and organ failure but did not differ between patients with or without obesity or type 2 diabetes. Visfatin levels correlated with biomarkers of renal failure, liver dysfunction, and other adipokines (e.g., resistin, leptin, and adiponectin) in critically ill patients. High visfatin levels at ICU admission indicated an increased mortality, both at the ICU and during long-term follow-up of approximately two years. Our data therefore demonstrate that circulating visfatin is a valuable biomarker for risk and prognosis assessment in critically ill patients. Furthermore, visfatin seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of excessive systemic inflammation, supporting further research on visfatin as a therapeutic target.',\n",
              " 'Adverse Cardiac Remodelling after Acute Myocardial Infarction: Old and New Biomarkers\\n\\nThe prevalence of heart failure (HF) due to cardiac remodelling after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) does not decrease regardless of implementation of new technologies supporting opening culprit coronary artery and solving of ischemia-relating stenosis with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Numerous studies have examined the diagnostic and prognostic potencies of circulating cardiac biomarkers in acute coronary syndrome/AMI and heart failure after AMI, and even fewer have depicted the utility of biomarkers in AMI patients undergoing primary PCI. Although complete revascularization at early period of acute coronary syndrome/AMI is an established factor for improved short-term and long-term prognosis and lowered risk of cardiovascular (CV) complications, late adverse cardiac remodelling may be a major risk factor for one-year mortality and postponded heart failure manifestation after PCI with subsequent blood flow resolving in culprit coronary artery. The aim of the review was to focus an attention on circulating biomarker as a promising tool to stratify AMI patients at high risk of poor cardiac recovery and developing HF after successful PCI. The main consideration affects biomarkers of inflammation, biomechanical myocardial stress, cardiac injury and necrosis, fibrosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular reparation. Clinical utilities and predictive modalities of natriuretic peptides, cardiac troponins, galectin 3, soluble suppressor tumorogenicity-2, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, growth differential factor-15, midregional proadrenomedullin, noncoding RNAs, and other biomarkers for adverse cardiac remodelling are discussed in the review.',\n",
              " 'Pretreatment Hepatitis C Virus NS5A/NS5B Resistance-Associated Substitutions in Genotype 1 Uruguayan Infected Patients\\n\\nHepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection treatment has dramatically changed with the advent of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). However, the efficacy of DAAs can be attenuated by the presence of resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) before and after treatment. Indeed, RASs detected in DAA treatment-naïve HCV-infected patients could be useful for clinical management and outcome prediction. Although the frequency of naturally occurring HCV NS5A and NS5B RASs has been addressed in many countries, there are only a few reports on their prevalence in the South American region. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence of RASs to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors in a DAA treatment naïve cohort of Uruguayan patients infected with chronic hepatitis C and compare them with reports from other South American countries. Here, we found that naturally occurring substitutions conferring resistance to NS5A and NS5B inhibitors were present in 8% and 19.2%, respectively, of treatment-naïve HCV genotype 1 infected patients. Importantly, the baseline substitutions in NS5A and NS5B herein identified differ from the studies previously reported in Brazil. Furthermore, Uruguayan strains subtype 1a clustered within all major world clades, showing that HCV variants currently circulating in this country are characterized by a remarkable genetic diversity.',\n",
              " 'Strong-LAMP Assay Based on a Strongyloides spp.-Derived Partial Sequence in the 18S rRNA as Potential Biomarker for Strongyloidiasis Diagnosis in Human Urine Samples\\n\\nHuman strongyloidiasis a soil-transmitted infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis is one of the most neglected amongst the so-called Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs). S. stercoralis is a nematode, which is distributed worldwide; it has been estimated that it could affect millions of people, mainly in tropical and subtropical endemic regions. The difficulties of diagnosis lead to infection rates being underreported. Asymptomatic patients have chronic infections that can lead to severe hyperinfection syndrome or disseminated strongyloidiasis in immunocompromised patients. Strongyloidiasis can easily be misdiagnosed because conventional faecal-based techniques lack of sensitivity for the morphological identification of infective larvae in faeces. None of the currently used molecular methods have used urine samples as an alternative to faecal samples for diagnosing strongyloidiasis. This study was thus aimed at comparing, for the first time, the use of a new loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) molecular assay (Strong-LAMP) to traditional methods on patients’ urine samples. Twenty-four urine samples were taken from patients included in a study involving two Spanish hospitals for strongyloidiasis screening using parasitological and serological tests. Strongyloides larvae were found in 11 patients’ faecal samples, thereby ascertaining that they had the disease. Other patients had high antibody titres but no larvae were found in their faeces. All urine samples were analysed by PCR and Strong-LAMP assay. No amplification occurred when using PCR. Strong-LAMP led to detecting S. stercoralis DNA in urine samples from patients having previously confirmed strongyloidiasis by parasitological tests and/or a suspicion of being infected by serological ones. The Strong-LAMP assay is a useful molecular tool for research regarding strongyloidiasis in human urine samples. After further validation, the Strong-LAMP assay could also be used for complementary and effective diagnosis of strongyloidiasis in a clinical setting.',\n",
              " 'Relationship between Long Noncoding RNA H19 Polymorphisms and Risk of Coronary Artery Disease in a Chinese Population: A Case-Control Study\\n\\nBackground/Aim. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major health problem that has high morbidity and mortality around the world. In recent years, long noncoding RNA H19 has been reported to affect the proliferation and apoptosis of vascular cells, which directly or indirectly results in atherosclerosis. We performed a case-control study to explore the relationship between H19 gene polymorphisms (rs2735971, rs2839698, and rs3024270) and the risk of CAD. Methods. We collected 732 samples from Liaoning Province, China, and three polymorphisms in long noncoding RNA H19 were genotyped using the KASP platform. Results. Our data showed that H19 rs2735971 and rs3024270 variant genotypes were associated with a decreased risk of CAD (rs2735971, , , ; rs3024270, , , ). No significant association with the risk of CAD was found for H19 rs2839698 polymorphism (). In haplotype analysis, H19 polymorphisms of rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C haplotype reduced the risk of CAD by 0.61-fold (, , ). In addition, we found that rs2839698 interacted with smoking (), and according to multifactor dimensionality reduction analysis, the three-factor model including H19 rs2839698-smoking-drinking was the best model for the risk of CAD (testing balanced ). Conclusion. Our study demonstrated that some genotypes of H19 rs2735971 and rs3024270 polymorphisms, as well as rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C haplotype, were associated with the risk of CAD in a Chinese population, and these genotypes have the potential to be biomarkers for predicting CAD risk. We also found that rs2735971-rs2839698-rs3024270 A-C-C may have a significantly lower risk of CAD. The recessive genetic model of rs3024270 could predict the severity of CAD.',\n",
              " 'Association between lncRNA GAS5, MEG3, and PCAT-1 Polymorphisms and Cancer Risk: A Meta-Analysis\\n\\nPurpose. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been widely studied, and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in lncRNAs are considered to be genetic factors that influence cancer susceptibility. The lncRNA GAS5, MEG3, and PCAT-1 polymorphisms are shown to be possibly associated with cancer risk. The aim of this meta-analysis was to systematically evaluate this association. Methods. Studies were selected from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) through inclusion and exclusion criteria. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model or fixed-effects model to assess the association between lncRNA polymorphisms and cancer susceptibility. Metaregression and publication bias analyses were also conducted. All analyses were performed using the Stata 12.0 software. Results. Sixteen articles (covering 13750 cases and 17194 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. A significant association between SNP rs145204276 and gastric cancer risk was observed (del vs. ins: , ; del/del vs. ins/ins+del/ins: , ; del/ins vs. ins/ins: , ). For rs16901904, a decreased cancer risk was observed in three genetic models (C vs. T: , ; CC vs. CT+TT: , ; CC vs. TT: , ). No statistical significance was found in the metaregression analysis. For all of the included SNPs, no publication bias was found in all genotype models. Conclusions. The rs145204276 SNP in lncRNA GAS5 is likely to be associated with gastric cancer risk, whereas the rs16901904 SNP in lncRNA PCAT-1 bears association with a decreased cancer risk.',\n",
              " 'Hepatic Subcapsular Flow as a Significant Diagnostic Marker for Biliary Atresia: A Meta-Analysis\\n\\nAim. Increasing evidence indicates that hepatic subcapsular flow (HSF) can serve as a noninvasive ultrasonographic marker for the early diagnosis of biliary atresia (BA). However, results regarding its diagnostic accuracy are inconsistent and inconclusive. We conducted this meta-analysis with an aim to systematically evaluate the diagnostic value of HSF in predicting BA. Methods. A comprehensive literature search of four databases was conducted to identify the eligible studies. All analyses were performed using STATA 12.0. Results. Nine studies from eight articles containing 368 patients and 469 controls were included in our meta-analysis. Briefly, the values for pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.95 (95% CI 0.88-0.98), 0.92 (95% CI 0.85-0.96), 11.6 (95% CI 6.3-21.5), 0.06 (95% CI 0.02-0.14), 201 (95% CI 59-689), and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), respectively. Additionally, metaregression along with subgroup analysis based on various covariates revealed the potential sources of heterogeneity and the detailed diagnostic value in each subgroup. Conclusion. Our meta-analysis showed that HSF assay could provide high accuracy in predicting BA patients and non-BA individuals. However, further studies with better design and larger sample size are required to support the results of the present study.',\n",

            "Motivation\n",
            "Association studies have been widely used to search for associations between common genetic variants observations and a given phenotype. However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation uniquely.\n",
            "\n",
            "Objective\n",
            "Our focus is on detecting interactions between groups of genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between environment and genome in the expression of a given phenotype.\n",
            "\n",
            "Contributions\n",
            "We propose a novel approach for efficiently detecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional setting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing.\n",
            "\n",
            "Results\n",
            "We compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere bacterial community.\n",

            "Non-parametric correction of estimated gene trees using TRACTION\n",
            "\n",
            "Estimated gene trees are often inaccurate, due to insufficient phylogenetic signal in the single gene alignment, among other causes. Gene tree correction aims to improve the accuracy of an estimated gene tree by using computational techniques along with auxiliary information, such as a reference species tree or sequencing data. However, gene trees and species trees can differ as a result of gene duplication and loss (GDL), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and other biological processes. Thus gene tree correction methods need to take estimation error as well as gene tree heterogeneity into account. Many prior gene tree correction methods have been developed for the case where GDL is present. Here, we study the problem of gene tree correction where gene tree heterogeneity is instead due to ILS and/or HGT. We introduce TRACTION, a simple polynomial time method that provably finds an optimal solution to the RF-optimal tree refinement and completion (RF-OTRC) Problem, which seeks a refinement and completion of a singly-labeled gene tree with respect to a given singly-labeled species tree so as to minimize the Robinson−Foulds (RF) distance. Our extensive simulation study on 68,000 estimated gene trees shows that TRACTION matches or improves on the accuracy of well-established methods from the GDL literature when HGT and ILS are both present, and ties for best under the ILS-only conditions. Furthermore, TRACTION ties for fastest on these datasets. We also show that a naive generalization of the RF-OTRC problem to multi-labeled trees is possible, but can produce misleading results where gene tree heterogeneity is due to GDL. \n",

            "\n",
            "Genome-wide optical maps are ordered high-resolution restriction maps that give the position of occurrence of restriction cut sites corresponding to one or more restriction enzymes. These genome-wide optical maps are assembled using an overlap-layout-consensus approach using raw optical map data, which are referred to as Rmaps. Due to the high error-rate of Rmap data, finding the overlap between Rmaps remains challenging. We present KOHDISTA, which is an index-based algorithm for finding pairwise alignments between single molecule maps (Rmaps). The novelty of our approach is the formulation of the alignment problem as automaton path matching, and the application of modern index-based data structures. In particular, we combine the use of the Generalized Compressed Suffix Array (GCSA) index with the wavelet tree in order to build KOHDISTA. We validate KOHDISTA on simulated E. coli data, showing the approach successfully finds alignments between Rmaps simulated from overlapping genomic regions. we demonstrate KOHDISTA is the only method that is capable of finding a significant number of high quality pairwise Rmap alignments for large eukaryote organisms in reasonable time.\n",

            "\n",
            "Genomic data analyses such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or Hi-C studies are often faced with the problem of partitioning chromosomes into successive regions based on a similarity matrix of high-resolution, locus-level measurements. An intuitive way of doing this is to perform a modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), where only adjacent clusters (according to the ordering of positions within a chromosome) are allowed to be merged. But a major practical drawback of this method is its quadratic time and space complexity in the number of loci, which is typically of the order of 104 to 105 for each chromosome. By assuming that the similarity between physically distant objects is negligible, we are able to propose an implementation of adjacency-constrained HAC with quasi-linear complexity. This is achieved by pre-calculating specific sums of similarities, and storing candidate fusions in a min-heap. Our illustrations on GWAS and Hi-C datasets demonstrate the relevance of this assumption, and show that this method highlights biologically meaningful signals. Thanks to its small time and memory footprint, the method can be run on a standard laptop in minutes or even seconds. Software and sample data are available as an R package, adjclust, that can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\n",

            "The evolutionary distance between two genomes can be estimated by computing a minimum length sequence of operations, called genome rearrangements, that transform one genome into another. Usually, a genome is modeled as an ordered sequence of genes, and most of the studies in the genome rearrangement literature consist in shaping biological scenarios into mathematical models. For instance, allowing different genome rearrangements operations at the same time, adding constraints to these rearrangements (e.g., each rearrangement can affect at most a given number of genes), considering that a rearrangement implies a cost depending on its length rather than a unit cost, etc. Most of the works, however, have overlooked some important features inside genomes, such as the presence of sequences of nucleotides between genes, called intergenic regions.\n",
            "In this work, we investigate the problem of computing the distance between two genomes, taking into account both gene order and intergenic sizes. The genome rearrangement operations we consider here are constrained types of reversals and transpositions, called super short reversals (SSRs) and super short transpositions (SSTs), which affect up to two (consecutive) genes. We denote by super short operations (SSOs) any SSR or SST. We show 3-approximation algorithms when the orientation of the genes is not considered when we allow SSRs, SSTs, or SSOs, and 5-approximation algorithms when considering the orientation for either SSRs or SSOs. We also show that these algorithms improve their approximation factors when the input permutation has a higher number of inversions, where the approximation factor decreases from 3 to either 2 or 1.5, and from 5 to either 3 or 2.\n",

            "Full Bayesian inference for detecting copy number variants (CNV) from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is still largely infeasible due to computational demands. A recently introduced approach to perform Forward–Backward Gibbs sampling using dynamic Haar wavelet compression has alleviated issues of convergence and, to some extent, speed. Yet, the problem remains challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithmic framework for this approach. We provide new space-efficient data structures to query sufficient statistics in logarithmic time, based on a linear-time, in-place transform of the data, which also improves on the compression ratio. We also propose a new approach to efficiently store and update marginal state counts obtained from the Gibbs sampler. Using this approach, we discover several CNV candidates in two rat populations divergently selected for tame and aggressive behavior, consistent with earlier results concerning the domestication syndrome as well as experimental observations. Computationally, we observe a 29.5-fold decrease in memory, an average 5.8-fold speedup, as well as a 191-fold decrease in minor page faults. We also observe that metrics varied greatly in the old implementation, but not the new one. We conjecture that this is due to the better compression scheme. The fully Bayesian segmentation of the entire WGS data set required 3.5 min and 1.24 GB of memory, and can hence be performed on a commodity laptop.\n",

This heterogeneity is the result of an evolutionary process, described by a phylogenetic tree. In addition to enabling clinicians to devise patient-specific treatment plans, phylogenetic trees of tumors enable researchers to decipher the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the problem of reconstructing a phylogenetic tree T given bulk sequencing data from a tumor is more complicated than the classic phylogeny inference problem. Rather than observing the leaves of T directly, we are given mutation frequencies that are the result of mixtures of the leaves of T. The majority of current tumor phylogeny inference methods employ the perfect phylogeny evolutionary model. The underlying PERFECT PHYLOGENY MIXTURE (PPM) combinatorial problem typically has multiple solutions.\n",

Using simulated and real data, we identify factors that contribute to and counteract non-uniqueness of solutions.

We derive the mixture of distributions of sequence similarity for duplicate gene pairs generated by repeated episodes of whole gene doubling. This involves integrating sequence divergence and gene pair loss through fractionation, using a branching process and a mutational model. We account not only for the timing of these events in terms of local modes, but also the amplitude and variance of the component distributions. This model is then extended to orthologous gene pairs. We apply the model and inference procedures to the evolution of the Solanaceae, focusing on the genomes of economically important crops.

In a clonal tree, each vertex represents a specific tumor clone, and is labeled with one or more mutations in a way that each mutation is assigned to the oldest clone that harbors it. Given two clonal trees, our multi-labeled tree dissimilarity (MLTD) measure is defined as the minimum number of mutation/label deletions, (empty) leaf deletions, and vertex (clonal) expansions, applied in any order, to convert each of the two trees to the maximum common tree. We show that the MLTD measure can be computed efficiently in polynomial time and it captures the similarity between trees of different clonal granularity well.\n",

            "The area of genome rearrangements has given rise to a number of interesting biological, mathematical and algorithmic problems. Among these, one of the most intractable ones has been that of finding the median of three genomes, a special case of the ancestral reconstruction problem. In this work we re-examine our recently proposed way of measuring genome rearrangement distance, namely, the rank distance between the matrix representations of the corresponding genomes, and show that the median of three genomes can be computed exactly in polynomial time O(nω), where ω≤3, with respect to this distance, when the median is allowed to be an arbitrary orthogonal matrix. We define the five fundamental subspaces depending on three input genomes, and use their properties to show that a particular action on each of these subspaces produces a median. In the process we introduce the notion of M-stable subspaces. We also show that the median found by our algorithm is always orthogonal, symmetric, and conserves any adjacencies or telomeres present in at least 2 out of 3 input genomes. We test our method on both simulated and real data. We find that the majority of the realistic inputs result in genomic outputs, and for those that do not, our two heuristics perform well in terms of reconstructing a genomic matrix attaining a score close to the lower bound, while running in a reasonable amount of time. We conclude that the rank distance is not only theoretically intriguing, but also practically useful for median-finding, and potentially ancestral genome reconstruction.\n",

These general instances can have an arbitrary number of circular and linear chromosomes, and arbitrary gene content. The practicality of the framework is displayed by presenting polynomial-time algorithms that generalize the results of Bulteau, Fertin, and Tannier on the SORTING BY WDCJS AND INDELS IN INTERGENES problem, and that generalize previous results on the MINIMUM LOCAL PARSIMONIOUS SCENARIO problem.\n",

            "The classical gene and species tree reconciliation, used to infer the history of gene gain and loss explaining the evolution of gene families, assumes an independent evolution for each family. While this assumption is reasonable for genes that are far apart in the genome, it is not appropriate for genes grouped into syntenic blocks, which are more plausibly the result of a concerted evolution. Here, we introduce the Super-Reconciliation problem which consists in inferring a history of segmental duplication and loss events (involving a set of neighboring genes) leading to a set of present-day syntenies from a single ancestral one. In other words, we extend the traditional Duplication-Loss reconciliation problem of a single gene tree, to a set of trees, accounting for segmental duplications and losses. Existency of a Super-Reconciliation depends on individual gene tree consistency. In addition, ignoring rearrangements implies that existency also depends on gene order consistency. We first show that the problem of reconstructing a most parsimonious Super-Reconciliation, if any, is NP-hard and give an exact exponential-time algorithm to solve it. Alternatively, we show that accounting for rearrangements in the evolutionary model, but still only minimizing segmental duplication and loss events, leads to an exact polynomial-time algorithm. We finally assess time efficiency of the former exponential time algorithm for the Duplication-Loss model on simulated datasets, and give a proof of concept on the opioid receptor genes.\n",

We prove that DAMOKLE identifies subnetworks with statistically significant difference in mutation frequency when the data comes from a reasonable generative model, provided enough samples are available.

            "Boolean models of biological signalling-regulatory networks are increasingly used to formally describe and understand complex biological processes. These models may become inconsistent as new data become available and need to be repaired. In the past, the focus has been shed on the inference of (classes of) models given an interaction network and time-series data sets. However, repair of existing models against new data is still in its infancy, where the process is still manually performed and therefore slow and prone to errors. In this work, we propose a method with an associated tool to suggest repairs over inconsistent Boolean models, based on a set of atomic repair operations. Answer Set Programming is used to encode the minimal repair problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. In particular, given an inconsistent model, the tool provides the minimal repairs that render the model capable of generating dynamics coherent with a (set of) time-series data set(s), considering either a synchronous or an asynchronous updating scheme. The method was validated using known biological models from different species, as well as synthetic models obtained from randomly generated networks. We discuss the method’s limitations regarding each of the updating schemes and the considered minimization algorithm.\n",

            "With long reads getting even longer and cheaper, large scale sequencing projects can be accomplished without short reads at an affordable cost. Due to the high error rates and less mature tools, de novo assembly of long reads is still challenging and often results in a large collection of contigs. Dense linkage maps are collections of markers whose location on the genome is approximately known. Therefore they provide long range information that has the potential to greatly aid in de novo assembly. Previously linkage maps have been used to detect misassemblies and to manually order contigs. However, no fully automated tools exist to incorporate linkage maps in assembly but instead large amounts of manual labour is needed to order the contigs into chromosomes. We formulate the genome assembly problem in the presence of linkage maps and present the first method for guided genome assembly using linkage maps. Our method is based on an additional cleaning step added to the assembly. We show that it can simplify the underlying assembly graph, resulting in more contiguous assemblies and reducing the amount of misassemblies when compared to de novo assembly. We present the first method to integrate linkage maps directly into genome assembly. With a modest increase in runtime, our method improves contiguity and correctness of genome assembly.\n",

However, it is well-known that the evolution of gene families is interconnected. In this paper, we extend a previous approach to reconcile a set of gene trees with a species tree based on segmental macro-evolutionary events, where segmental duplication events and losses are associated with cost δ and λ, respectively. We show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when δ≤λ (via LCA-mapping), while if δ>λ the problem is NP-hard, even when λ=0 and a single gene tree is given, solving a long standing open problem on the complexity of multi-gene reconciliation. On the positive side, we give a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem, where the parameters are δ/λ and the number d of segmental duplications, of time complexity O(⌈δλ⌉d⋅n⋅δλ). Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm on two previously studied real datasets: we first show that our method can be used to confirm or raise doubt on hypothetical segmental duplications on a set of 16 eukaryotes, then show how we can detect whole genome duplications in yeast genomes.\n",

            "Network connectivity problems are abundant in computational biology research, where graphs are used to represent a range of phenomena: from physical interactions between molecules to more abstract relationships such as gene co-expression. One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner Network problems: given a reference “database” graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands. While this formulation proved useful in a number of instances, the next challenge is to account for the fact that the reference graph may not be static. This can happen for instance, when studying protein measurements in single cells or at different time points, whereby different subsets of conditions can have different protein milieu. We introduce the condition Steiner Network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition. We show that introducing multiple conditions as an additional factor makes this problem much harder to approximate. Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C−ϵ, for every C≥2 and ϵ>0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver. Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.\n",

            "Sequencing technologies keep on turning cheaper and faster, thus putting a growing pressure for data structures designed to efficiently store raw data, and possibly perform analysis therein. In this view, there is a growing interest in alignment-free and reference-free variants calling methods that only make use of (suitably indexed) raw reads data. We develop the positional clustering theory that (i) describes how the extended Burrows–Wheeler Transform (eBWT) of a collection of reads tends to cluster together bases that cover the same genome position (ii) predicts the size of such clusters, and (iii) exhibits an elegant and precise LCP array based procedure to locate such clusters in the eBWT. Based on this theory, we designed and implemented an alignment-free and reference-free SNPs calling method, and we devised a consequent SNPs calling pipeline. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that SNPs can be detected with a simple scan of the eBWT and LCP arrays as, in accordance with our theoretical framework, they are within clusters in the eBWT of the reads. Finally, our tool intrinsically performs a reference-free evaluation of its accuracy by returning the coverage of each SNP. Based on the results of the experiments on synthetic and real data, we conclude that the positional clustering framework can be effectively used for the problem of identifying SNPs, and it appears to be a promising approach for calling other type of variants directly on raw sequencing data. \n",

            "Absolute fast converging (AFC) phylogeny estimation methods are ones that have been proven to recover the true tree with high probability given sequences whose lengths are polynomial in the number of number of leaves in the tree (once the shortest and longest branch weights are fixed). While there has been a large literature on AFC methods, the best in terms of empirical performance was DCMNJ, published in SODA 2001. The main empirical advantage of DCMNJ over other AFC methods is its use of neighbor joining (NJ) to construct trees on smaller taxon subsets, which are then combined into a tree on the full set of species using a supertree method; in contrast, the other AFC methods in essence depend on quartet trees that are computed independently of each other, which reduces accuracy compared to neighbor joining. However, DCMNJ is unlikely to scale to large datasets due to its reliance on supertree methods, as no current supertree methods are able to scale to large datasets with high accuracy. In this study we present a new approach to large-scale phylogeny estimation that shares some of the features of DCMNJ but bypasses the use of supertree methods. We prove that this new approach is AFC and uses polynomial time and space. Furthermore, we describe variations on this basic approach that can be used with leaf-disjoint constraint trees (computed using methods such as maximum likelihood) to produce other methods that are likely to provide even better accuracy. Thus, we present a new generalizable technique for large-scale tree estimation that is designed to improve scalability for phylogeny estimation methods to ultra-large datasets, and that can be used in a variety of settings (including tree estimation from unaligned sequences, and species tree estimation from gene trees).\n",

Charges are accompanied by a score that depends on their observed frequency in similar neighbourhoods (chemical environments) in a database of previously parameterised molecules. The aim is to assign the charges such that the total charge equals a known target charge within a margin of error while maximizing the sum of the charge scores. We show that the problem is a variant of the well-studied multiple-choice knapsack problem and thus weakly NP-complete. We propose solutions based on Integer Linear Programming and a pseudo-polynomial time Dynamic Programming algorithm. We demonstrate that the results obtained for novel molecules not included in the database are comparable to the ones obtained performing explicit charge calculations while decreasing the time to determine partial charges for a molecule from hours or even days to below a second.

They typically generate sequence lists ranked by an experimentally acquired functional property such as gene expression or protein binding affinity. Current motif discovery tools suffer from limitations in searching large motif spaces, and thus more complex motifs may not be included. There is thus a need for motif analysis methods that are tailored for analyzing specific complex motifs motivated by biological questions and hypotheses rather than acting as a screen based motif finding tool. We present Regmex (REGular expression Motif EXplorer), which offers several methods to identify overrepresented motifs in ranked lists of sequences. Regmex uses regular expressions to define motifs or families of motifs and embedded Markov models to calculate exact p-values for motif observations in sequences. Biases in motif distributions across ranked sequence lists are evaluated using random walks, Brownian bridges, or modified rank based statistics. A modular setup and fast analytic p value evaluations make Regmex applicable to diverse and potentially large-scale motif analysis problems. We demonstrate use cases of combined motifs on simulated data and on expression data from micro RNA transfection experiments. We confirm previously obtained results and demonstrate the usability of Regmex to test a specific hypothesis about the relative location of microRNA seed sites and U-rich motifs. We further compare the tool with an existing motif discovery tool and show increased sensitivity. Regmex is a useful and flexible tool to analyze motif hypotheses that relates to large data sets in functional genomics.

Their practical importance derives from the fact they are connected to their host graph by a single entrance and a single exit vertex, thus allowing them to be handled independently. Efficient algorithms for the enumeration of superbubbles are therefore of important for the processing of HTS data. Superbubbles can be identified within the strongly connected components of the input digraph after transforming them into directed acyclic graphs. The algorithm by Sung et al. (IEEE ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform 12:770–777, 2015) achieves this task in O(m log(m))-time. The extraction of superbubbles from the transformed components was later improved to by Brankovic et al. (Theor Comput Sci 609:374–383, 2016) resulting in an overall O(m+n)-time algorithm. A re-analysis of the mathematical structure of superbubbles showed that the construction of auxiliary DAGs from the strongly connected components in the work of Sung et al. missed some details that can lead to the reporting of false positive superbubbles. We propose an alternative, even simpler auxiliary graph that solved the problem and retains the linear running time for general digraph. Furthermore, we describe a simpler, space-efficient O(m+n)-time algorithm for detecting superbubbles in DAGs that uses only simple data structures. We present a reference implementation of the algorithm that accepts many commonly used formats for the input graph and provides convenient access to the improved algorithm. https://github.com/Fabianexe/Superbubble.\n",

Because subtle features are central for explaining how proteins achieve specificity, algorithmic efficiency and geometric precision are central to algorithmic design. To address these concerns, this paper presents pClay, the first algorithm to perform parallel and arbitrarily precise comparisons of molecular surfaces and electrostatic isopotentials as geometric solids. pClay was presented at the 2019 Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI 2019) and is described in expanded detail here, especially with regard to the comparison of electrostatic isopotentials. Earlier methods have generally used parallelism to enhance computational throughput, pClay is the first algorithm to use parallelism to make arbitrarily high precision comparisons practical. It is also the first method to demonstrate that high precision comparisons of geometric solids can yield more precise structural inferences than algorithms that use existing standards of precision. One advantage of added precision is that statistical models can be trained with more accurate data. Using structural data from an existing method, a model of steric variations between binding cavities can overlook 53% of authentic steric influences on specificity, whereas a model trained with data from pClay overlooks none. Our results also demonstrate the parallel performance of pClay on both workstation CPUs and a 61-core Xeon Phi. While slower on one core, additional processor cores rapidly outpaced single core performance and existing methods. Based on these results, it is clear that pClay has applications in the automatic explanation of binding mechanisms and in the rational design of protein binding preferences.\n",

As a consequence the demand for methods supporting comparative, evolutionary analysis is also growing. In particular, efficient tools to visualize-omics data simultaneously for multiple species are sorely lacking. A first and crucial step in this direction is the construction of a common coordinate system. Since genomes not only differ by rearrangements but also by large insertions, deletions, and duplications, the use of a single reference genome is insufficient, in particular when the number of species becomes large. The computational problem then becomes to determine an order and orientations of optimal local alignments that are as co-linear as possible with all the genome sequences. We first review the most prominent approaches to model the problem formally and then proceed to showing that it can be phrased as a particular variant of the BETWEENNESS PROBLEM. It is NP hard in general. As exact solutions are beyond reach for the problem sizes of practical interest, we introduce a collection of heuristic simplifiers to resolve ordering conflicts. Benchmarks on real-life data ranging from bacterial to fly genomes demonstrate the feasibility of computing good common coordinate systems.\n",

            "Liquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry is an important tool in proteomics for peptide identification. Liquid chromatography temporally separates the peptides in a sample. The peptides that elute one after another are analyzed via tandem mass spectrometry by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of a peptide and its fragments. De novo peptide sequencing is the problem of reconstructing the amino acid sequences of a peptide from this measurement data. Past de novo sequencing algorithms solely consider the mass spectrum of the fragments for reconstructing a sequence. We propose to additionally exploit the information obtained from liquid chromatography. We study the problem of computing a sequence that is not only in accordance with the experimental mass spectrum, but also with the chromatographic retention time. We consider three models for predicting the retention time and develop algorithms for de novo sequencing for each model. Based on an evaluation for two prediction models on experimental data from synthesized peptides we conclude that the identification rates are improved by exploiting the chromatographic information. In our evaluation, we compare our algorithms using the retention time information with algorithms using the same scoring model, but not the retention time.\n",

            "One way to estimate the evolutionary distance between two given genomes is to determine the minimum number of large-scale mutations, or genome rearrangements, that are necessary to transform one into the other. In this context, genomes can be represented as ordered sequences of genes, each gene being represented by a signed integer. If no gene is repeated, genomes are thus modeled as signed permutations of the form \\pi =(\\pi _1 \\pi _2 \\ldots \\pi _n), and in that case we can consider without loss of generality that one of them is the identity permutation \\iota _n =(1 2 \\ldots n), and that we just need to sort the other (i.e., transform it into \\iota _n). The most studied genome rearrangement events are reversals, where a segment of the genome is reversed and reincorporated at the same location; and transpositions, where two consecutive segments are exchanged. Many variants, e.g., combining different types of (possibly constrained) rearrangements, have been proposed in the literature. One of them considers that the number of genes involved, in a reversal or a transposition, is never greater than two, which is known as the problem of sorting by super short operations (or SSOs). All problems considering SSOs in permutations have been shown to be in P, except for one, namely sorting signed circular permutations by super short reversals and super short transpositions. Here we fill this gap by introducing a new graph structure called cyclic permutation graph and providing a series of intermediate results, which allows us to design a polynomial algorithm for sorting signed circular permutations by super short reversals and super short transpositions.\n",

            "Most phylogenetic studies using molecular data treat gaps in multiple sequence alignments as missing data or even completely exclude alignment columns that contain gaps. Here we show that gap patterns in large-scale, genome-wide alignments are themselves phylogenetically informative and can be used to infer reliable phylogenies provided the gap data are properly filtered to reduce noise introduced by the alignment method. We introduce here the notion of split-inducing indels (splids) that define an approximate bipartition of the taxon set. We show both in simulated data and in case studies on real-life data that splids can be efficiently extracted from phylogenomic data sets. Suitably processed gap patterns extracted from genome-wide alignment provide a surprisingly clear phylogenetic signal and an allow the inference of accurate phylogenetic trees.\n",

            "Horizontal gene transfer (HGT), a process of acquisition and fixation of foreign genetic material, is an important biological phenomenon. Several approaches to HGT inference have been proposed. However, most of them either rely on approximate, non-phylogenetic methods or on the tree reconciliation, which is computationally intensive and sensitive to parameter values. We investigate the locus tree inference problem as a possible alternative that combines the advantages of both approaches. We present several algorithms to solve the problem in the parsimony framework. We introduce a novel tree mapping, which allows us to obtain a heuristic solution to the problems of locus tree inference and duplication classification. Our approach allows for faster comparisons of gene and species trees and improves known algorithms for duplication inference in the presence of polytomies in the species trees.

            "Haplotype assembly, reconstructing haplotypes from sequence data, is one of the major computational problems in bioinformatics. Most of the current methodologies for haplotype assembly are designed for diploid individuals. In recent years, genomes having more than two sets of homologous chromosomes have attracted many research groups that are interested in the genomics of disease, phylogenetics, botany and evolution. However, there is still a lack of methods for reconstructing polyploid haplotypes. In this work, the minimum error correction with genotype information (MEC/GI) model, an important combinatorial model for haplotyping a single individual, is used to study the triploid individual haplotype reconstruction problem. A fast and accurate enumeration-based algorithm enumeration haplotyping triploid with least difference (EHTLD) is proposed for solving the MEC/GI model. The EHTLD algorithm tries to reconstruct the three haplotypes according to the order of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci along them. When reconstructing a given SNP site, the EHTLD algorithm enumerates three kinds of SNP values in terms of the corresponding site’s genotype value, and chooses the one, which leads to the minimum difference between the reconstructed haplotypes and the sequenced fragments covering that SNP site, to fill the SNP loci being reconstructed. Extensive experimental comparisons were performed between the EHTLD algorithm and the well known HapCompass and HapTree. Compared with algorithms HapCompass and HapTree, the EHTLD algorithm can reconstruct more accurate haplotypes, which were proven by a number of experiments.\n",

            "The double cut and join (DCJ) model of genome rearrangement is well studied due to its mathematical simplicity and power to account for the many events that transform gene order. These studies have mostly been devoted to the understanding of minimum length scenarios transforming one genome into another. In this paper we search instead for rearrangement scenarios that minimize the number of rearrangements whose breakpoints are unlikely due to some biological criteria. One such criterion has recently become accessible due to the advent of the Hi-C experiment, facilitating the study of 3D spacial distance between breakpoint regions. We establish a link between the minimum number of unlikely rearrangements required by a scenario and the problem of finding a maximum edge-disjoint cycle packing on a certain transformed version of the adjacency graph. This link leads to a 3/2-approximation as well as an exact integer linear programming formulation for our problem, which we prove to be NP-complete. We also present experimental results on fruit flies, showing that Hi-C data is informative when used as a criterion for rearrangements. A new variant of the weighted DCJ distance problem is addressed that ignores scenario length in its objective function. A solution to this problem provides a lower bound on the number of unlikely moves necessary when transforming one gene order into another. This lower bound aids in the study of rearrangement scenarios with respect to chromatin structure, and could eventually be used in the design of a fixed parameter algorithm with a more general objective function.\n",

            "Patterns with wildcards in specified positions, namely spaced seeds, are increasingly used instead of k-mers in many bioinformatics applications that require indexing, querying and rapid similarity search, as they can provide better sensitivity. Many of these applications require to compute the hashing of each position in the input sequences with respect to the given spaced seed, or to multiple spaced seeds. While the hashing of k-mers can be rapidly computed by exploiting the large overlap between consecutive k-mers, spaced seeds hashing is usually computed from scratch for each position in the input sequence, thus resulting in slower processing. The method proposed in this paper, fast spaced-seed hashing (FSH), exploits the similarity of the hash values of spaced seeds computed at adjacent positions in the input sequence. In our experiments we compute the hash for each positions of metagenomics reads from several datasets, with respect to different spaced seeds. We also propose a generalized version of the algorithm for the simultaneous computation of multiple spaced seeds hashing. In the experiments, our algorithm can compute the hashing values of spaced seeds with a speedup, with respect to the traditional approach, between 1.6× to 5.3×, depending on the structure of the spaced seed. Spaced seed hashing is a routine task for several bioinformatics application. FSH allows to perform this task efficiently and raise the question of whether other hashing can be exploited to further improve the speed up. This has the potential of major impact in the field, making spaced seed applications not only accurate, but also faster and more efficient.\n",

            "\n",
            "An important task in a metagenomic analysis is the assignment of taxonomic labels to sequences in a sample. Most widely used methods for taxonomy assignment compare a sequence in the sample to a database of known sequences. Many approaches use the best BLAST hit(s) to assign the taxonomic label. However, it is known that the best BLAST hit may not always correspond to the best taxonomic match. An alternative approach involves phylogenetic methods, which take into account alignments and a model of evolution in order to more accurately define the taxonomic origin of sequences. Similarity-search based methods typically run faster than phylogenetic methods and work well when the organisms in the sample are well represented in the database. In contrast, phylogenetic methods have the capability to identify new organisms in a sample but are computationally quite expensive. We propose a two-step approach for metagenomic taxon identification; i.e., use a rapid method that accurately classifies sequences using a reference database (this is a filtering step) and then use a more complex phylogenetic method for the sequences that were unclassified in the previous step. In this work, we explore whether and when using top BLAST hit(s) yields a correct taxonomic label. We develop a method to detect outliers among BLAST hits in order to separate the phylogenetically most closely related matches from matches to sequences from more distantly related organisms. We used modified BILD (Bayesian Integral Log-Odds) scores, a multiple-alignment scoring function, to define the outliers within a subset of top BLAST hits and assign taxonomic labels. We compared the accuracy of our method to the RDP classifier and show that our method yields fewer misclassifications while properly classifying organisms that are not present in the database. Finally, we evaluated the use of our method as a pre-processing step before more expensive phylogenetic analyses (in our case TIPP) in the context of real 16S rRNA datasets. Our experiments make a good case for using a two-step approach for accurate taxonomic assignment. We show that our method can be used as a filtering step before using phylogenetic methods and provides a way to interpret BLAST results using more information than provided by E-values and bit-scores alone.\n",

            "\n",
            "For a combination of reasons (including data generation protocols, approaches to taxon and gene sampling, and gene birth and loss), estimated gene trees are often incomplete, meaning that they do not contain all of the species of interest. As incomplete gene trees can impact downstream analyses, accurate completion of gene trees is desirable. We introduce the Optimal Tree Completion problem, a general optimization problem that involves completing an unrooted binary tree (i.e., adding missing leaves) so as to minimize its distance from a reference tree on a superset of the leaves. We present OCTAL, an algorithm that finds an optimal solution to this problem when the distance between trees is defined using the Robinson–Foulds (RF) distance, and we prove that OCTAL runs in O(n2) time, where n is the total number of species. We report on a simulation study in which gene trees can differ from the species tree due to incomplete lineage sorting, and estimated gene trees are completed using OCTAL with a reference tree based on a species tree estimated from the multi-locus dataset. OCTAL produces completed gene trees that are closer to the true gene trees than an existing heuristic approach in ASTRAL-II, but the accuracy of a completed gene tree computed by OCTAL depends on how topologically similar the reference tree (typically an estimated species tree) is to the true gene tree. OCTAL is a useful technique for adding missing taxa to incomplete gene trees and provides good accuracy under a wide range of model conditions. However, results show that OCTAL’s accuracy can be reduced when incomplete lineage sorting is high, as the reference tree can be far from the true gene tree. Hence, this study suggests that OCTAL would benefit from using other types of reference trees instead of species trees when there are large topological distances between true gene trees and species trees.\n",

            "\n",
            "In the field of genome rearrangement algorithms, models accounting for gene duplication lead often to hard problems. For example, while computing the pairwise distance is tractable in most duplication-free models, the problem is NP-complete for most extensions of these models accounting for duplicated genes. Moreover, problems involving more than two genomes, such as the genome median and the Small Parsimony problem, are intractable for most duplication-free models, with some exceptions, for example the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) model. We introduce a variant of the SCJ distance that accounts for duplicated genes, in the context of directed evolution from an ancestral genome to a descendant genome where orthology relations between ancestral genes and their descendant are known. Our model includes two duplication mechanisms: single-gene tandem duplication and the creation of single-gene circular chromosomes. We prove that in this model, computing the directed distance and a parsimonious evolutionary scenario in terms of SCJ and single-gene duplication events can be done in linear time. We also show that the directed median problem is tractable for this distance, while the rooted median problem, where we assume that one of the given genomes is ancestral to the median, is NP-complete. We also describe an Integer Linear Program for solving this problem. We evaluate the directed distance and rooted median algorithms on simulated data. Our results provide a simple genome rearrangement model, extending the SCJ model to account for single-gene duplications, for which we prove a mix of tractability and hardness results. For the NP-complete rooted median problem, we design a simple Integer Linear Program. Our publicly available implementation of these algorithms for the directed distance and median problems allow to solve efficiently these problems on large instances.\n",

            "A profile-comparison method with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is among the most accurate alignment methods. Currently, cosine similarity and correlation coefficients are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear whether these functions are optimal for profile alignment methods. By definition, these functions cannot capture nonlinear relationships between profiles. Therefore, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was more suitable for the profile-comparison method than existing functions, using neural networks. Although neural networks required derivative-of-cost functions, the problem being addressed in this study lacked them. Therefore, we implemented a novel derivative-free neural network by combining a conventional neural network with an evolutionary strategy optimization method used as a solver. Using this novel neural network system, we optimized the scoring function to align remote sequence pairs. Our results showed that the pairwise-profile aligner using the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision relative to aligners using existing functions. We developed and implemented a novel derivative-free neural network and aligner (Nepal) for optimizing sequence alignments. Nepal improved alignment quality by adapting to remote sequence alignments and increasing the expressiveness of similarity scores. Additionally, this novel scoring function can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into other aligners. Moreover our scoring function could potentially improve the performance of homology detection and/or multiple-sequence alignment of remote homologous sequences. The goal of the study was to provide a novel scoring function for profile alignment method and develop a novel learning system capable of addressing derivative-free problems. Our system is capable of optimizing the performance of other sophisticated methods and solving problems without derivative-of-cost functions, which do not always exist in practical problems. Our results demonstrated the usefulness of this optimization method for derivative-free problems.\n",

            "Microbial typing methods are commonly used to study the relatedness of bacterial strains. Sequence-based typing methods are a gold standard for epidemiological surveillance due to the inherent portability of sequence and allelic profile data, fast analysis times and their capacity to create common nomenclatures for strains or clones. This led to development of several novel methods and several databases being made available for many microbial species. With the mainstream use of High Throughput Sequencing, the amount of data being accumulated in these databases is huge, storing thousands of different profiles. On the other hand, computing genetic evolutionary distances among a set of typing profiles or taxa dominates the running time of many phylogenetic inference methods. It is important also to note that most of genetic evolution distance definitions rely, even if indirectly, on computing the pairwise Hamming distance among sequences or profiles. We propose here an average-case linear-time algorithm to compute pairwise Hamming distances among a set of taxa under a given Hamming distance threshold. This article includes both a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results concerning the proposed algorithm. We further show how this algorithm can be successfully integrated into a well known phylogenetic inference method, and how it can be used to speedup querying local phylogenetic patterns over large typing databases.\n",

            "Reconstructing the genome of a species from short fragments is one of the oldest bioinformatics problems. Metagenomic assembly is a variant of the problem asking to reconstruct the circular genomes of all bacterial species present in a sequencing sample. This problem can be naturally formulated as finding a collection of circular walks of a directed graph G that together cover all nodes, or edges, of G. We address this problem with the “safe and complete” framework of Tomescu and Medvedev (Research in computational Molecular biology—20th annual conference, RECOMB 9649:152–163, 2016). An algorithm is called safe if it returns only those walks (also called safe) that appear as subwalk in all metagenomic assembly solutions for G. A safe algorithm is called complete if it returns all safe walks of G. We give graph-theoretic characterizations of the safe walks of G, and a safe and complete algorithm finding all safe walks of G. In the node-covering case, our algorithm runs in time O(m2+n3), and in the edge-covering case it runs in time O(m2n); n and m denote the number of nodes and edges, respectively, of G. This algorithm constitutes the first theoretical tight upper bound on what can be safely assembled from metagenomic reads using this problem formulation.\n",

            "In the absence of horizontal gene transfer it is possible to reconstruct the history of gene families from empirically determined orthology relations, which are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees. Knowledge of the event labels considerably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species trees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the event types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled case may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here we investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation problem with horizontal transfer. We investigate the issue of time-consistency for the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a convenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of time-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak conditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which evolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an O(|V(T)|log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent reconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit timing maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking whether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic. The algorithms are implemented in C++ using the boost graph library and are freely available at https://github.com/Nojgaard/tc-recon. The combinatorial characterization of time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an important step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal transfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees. The fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context because it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree reconciliation problems.\n",

In its standard formulation, the objective is to find a species tree that minimizes the total number of gene duplications and losses with respect to the input set of gene trees. Although much is known about GTP, little is known about how to treat inputs containing some incomplete gene trees (i.e., gene trees lacking one or more of the species). We present new theory for GTP considering whether the incompleteness is due to gene birth and death (i.e., true biological loss) or taxon sampling, and present dynamic programming algorithms that can be used for an exact but exponential time solution for small numbers of taxa, or as a heuristic for larger numbers of taxa. We also prove that the “standard” calculations for duplications and losses exactly solve GTP when incompleteness results from taxon sampling, although they can be incorrect when incompleteness results from true biological loss.

In this article we present and analyze eGSA [introduced in CPM (External memory generalized suffix and LCP arrays construction. In: Proceedings of CPM. pp 201–10, 2013)], the first external memory algorithm to construct generalized suffix arrays augmented with the longest common prefix array for a string collection. Our algorithm relies on a combination of buffers, induced sorting and a heap to avoid direct string comparisons. We performed experiments that covered different aspects of our algorithm, including running time, efficiency, external memory access, internal phases and the influence of different optimization strategies. On real datasets of size up to 24 GB and using 2 GB of internal memory, eGSA showed a competitive performance when compared to eSAIS and SAscan, which are efficient algorithms for a single string according to the related literature. We also show the effect of disk caching managed by the operating system on our algorithm. The proposed algorithm was validated through performance tests using real datasets from different domains, in various combinations, and showed a competitive performance.

            "In order to find correlated pairs of positions between proteins, which are useful in predicting interactions, it is necessary to concatenate two large multiple sequence alignments such that the sequences that are joined together belong to those that interact in their species of origin. When each protein is unique then the species name is sufficient to guide this match, however, when there are multiple related sequences (paralogs) in each species then the pairing is more difficult. In bacteria a good guide can be gained from genome co-location as interacting proteins tend to be in a common operon but in eukaryotes this simple principle is not sufficient. The methods developed in this paper take sets of paralogs for different proteins found in the same species and make a pairing based on their evolutionary distance relative to a set of other proteins that are unique and so have a known relationship (singletons). The former constitute a set of unlabelled nodes in a graph while the latter are labelled. Two variants were tested, one based on a phylogenetic tree of the sequences (the topology-based method) and a simpler, faster variant based only on the inter-sequence distances (the distance-based method). Over a set of test proteins, both gave good results, with the topology method performing slightly better. The methods develop here still need refinement and augmentation from constraints other than the sequence data alone, such as known interactions from annotation and databases, or non-trivial relationships in genome location. With the ever growing numbers of eukaryotic genomes, it is hoped that the methods described here will open a route to the use of these data equal to the current success attained with bacterial sequences.\n",

            "The history of gene families—which are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees—can be reconstructed from empirically estimated evolutionary event-relations containing pairs of orthologous, paralogous or xenologous genes. The question then arises as whether inferred event-labeled gene trees are biologically feasible, that is, if there is a possible true history that would explain a given gene tree. In practice, this problem is boiled down to finding a reconciliation map—also known as DTL-scenario—between the event-labeled gene trees and a (possibly unknown) species tree. In this contribution, we first characterize whether there is a valid reconciliation map for binary event-labeled gene trees T that contain speciation, duplication and horizontal gene transfer events and some unknown species tree S in terms of “informative” triples that are displayed in T and provide information of the topology of S. These informative triples are used to infer the unknown species tree S for T. We obtain a similar result for non-binary gene trees. To this end, however, the reconciliation map needs to be further restricted. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there is a species tree for a given event-labeled gene tree, and in the positive case, to construct the species tree and the respective (restricted) reconciliation map. However, informative triples as well as DTL-scenarios have their limitations when they are used to explain the biological feasibility of gene trees. While reconciliation maps imply biological feasibility, we show that the converse is not true in general. Moreover, we show that informative triples neither provide enough information to characterize “relaxed” DTL-scenarios nor non-restricted reconciliation maps for non-binary biologically feasible gene trees.\n",

In mitochondrial genomes different mechanisms are likely at work, at least some of which involve the duplication of sequence around the location of the apparent breakpoints. We hypothesize that these different mechanisms of genome rearrangement leave distinctive sequence footprints. In order to study such effects it is important to locate the breakpoint positions with precision. We define a partially local sequence alignment problem that assumes that following a rearrangement of a sequence F, two fragments L, and R are produced that may exactly fit together to match F, leave a gap of deleted DNA between L and R, or overlap with each other. We show that this alignment problem can be solved by dynamic programming in cubic space and time. We apply the new method to evaluate rearrangements of animal mitogenomes and find that a surprisingly large fraction of these events involved local sequence duplications. The partially local sequence alignment method is an effective way to investigate the mechanism of genomic rearrangement events. While applied here only to mitogenomes there is no reason why the method could not be used to also consider rearrangements in nuclear genomes.\n",

Among the most widely used methods in this class is the standard bootstrap method, which consists of random sampling with replacement. While not requiring assumptions about any particular parametric model for resampling purposes, the bootstrap and related techniques assume that sites are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The i.i.d. assumption can be an over-simplification for many problems in computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular, sequential dependence within biomolecular sequences is often an essential biological feature due to biochemical function, evolutionary processes such as recombination, and other factors. To relax the simplifying i.i.d. assumption, we propose a new non-parametric/semi-parametric sequential resampling technique that generalizes “Heads-or-Tails” mirrored inputs, a simple but clever technique due to Landan and Graur. The generalized procedure takes the form of random walks along either aligned or unaligned biomolecular sequences. We refer to our new method as the SERES (or “SEquential RESampling”) method. To demonstrate the performance of the new technique, we apply SERES to estimate support for the multiple sequence alignment problem.

While ad-hoc corrections have been proposed to mitigate this problem, we propose a different approach to parameter estimation for beta mixtures where such problems do not arise in the first place. Our algorithm combines latent variables with the method of moments instead of maximum likelihood, which has computational advantages over the popular EM algorithm. As an application, we demonstrate that methylation state classification is more accurate when using adaptive thresholds from beta mixtures than non-adaptive thresholds on observed methylation levels. We also demonstrate that we can accurately infer the number of mixture components. The hybrid algorithm between likelihood-based component un-mixing and moment-based parameter estimation is a robust and efficient method for beta mixture estimation.

The second problem arises when the two trees to be compared have only partially overlapping leaf sets. The traditional approach to handling these problems is to first restrict the two trees to their common leaf set. An alternative approach that has shown promise is to first complete the trees by adding missing leaves, so that the resulting trees have identical leaf sets. This requires the computation of an optimal completion that minimizes the distance between the two resulting trees over all possible completions.\n",

This approximation of best matches by best hits becomes exact for ultrametric dissimilarities, i.e., under the Molecular Clock Hypothesis. It fails, however, whenever there are large lineage specific rate variations among paralogous genes. In practice, this introduces a high level of noise into the input data for best-hit-based orthology detection methods. If additive distances between genes are known, then evolutionary most closely related pairs can be identified by considering certain quartets of genes provided that in each quartet the outgroup relative to the remaining three genes is known. A priori knowledge of underlying species phylogeny greatly facilitates the identification of the required outgroup. Although the workflow remains a heuristic since the correct outgroup cannot be determined reliably in all cases, simulations with lineage specific biases and rate asymmetries show that nearly perfect results can be achieved. In a realistic setting, where distances data have to be estimated from sequence data and hence are noisy, it is still possible to obtain highly accurate sets of best matches.\n",

A common task is the inference of phylogenies—a challenging task if close reference sequences are not available, genome sequences are incompletely assembled, or the high number of genomes precludes multiple sequence alignment in reasonable time. We present a new whole-genome based approach to infer phylogenies that is alignment- and reference-free. In contrast to other methods, it does not rely on pairwise comparisons to determine distances to infer edges in a tree. Instead, a colored de Bruijn graph is constructed, and information on common subsequences is extracted to infer phylogenetic splits. The introduced new methodology for large-scale phylogenomics shows high potential. Application to different datasets confirms robustness of the approach. A comparison to other state-of-the-art whole-genome based methods indicates comparable or higher accuracy and efficiency.\n",

            "\n",
            "Advances in molecular biology have resulted in big and complicated data sets, therefore a clustering approach that able to capture the actual structure and the hidden patterns of the data is required. Moreover, the geometric space may not reflects the actual similarity between the different objects. As a result, in this research we use clustering-based space that convert the geometric space of the molecular to a categorical space based on clustering results. Then we use this space for developing a new classification algorithm. In this study, we propose a new classification method named GrpClassifierEC that replaces the given data space with categorical space based on ensemble clustering (EC). The EC space is defined by tracking the membership of the points over multiple runs of clustering algorithms. Different points that were included in the same clusters will be represented as a single point. Our algorithm classifies all these points as a single class. The similarity between two objects is defined as the number of times that these objects were not belong to the same cluster. In order to evaluate our suggested method, we compare its results to the k nearest neighbors, Decision tree and Random forest classification algorithms on several benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the suggested new algorithm GrpClassifierEC outperforms the other algorithms. Our algorithm can be integrated with many other algorithms. In this research, we use only the k-means clustering algorithm with different k values. In future research, we propose several directions: (1) checking the effect of the clustering algorithm to build an ensemble clustering space. (2) Finding poor clustering results based on the training data, (3) reducing the volume of the data by combining similar points based on the EC.\n"

However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation uniquely.\\n\\nObjective\\nOur focus is on detecting interactions between groups of genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between environment and genome in the expression of a given phenotype.\\n\\nContributions\\nWe propose a novel approach for efficiently detecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional setting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing.\\n\\nResults\\nWe compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere bacterial community.\\n\\nSoftware availability\\nAn R package is available [4], along with its documentation and associated scripts, allowing the reader to reproduce the results presented in the paper.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Non-parametric correction of estimated gene trees using TRACTION\\n\\nEstimated gene trees are often inaccurate, due to insufficient phylogenetic signal in the single gene alignment, among other causes. Gene tree correction aims to improve the accuracy of an estimated gene tree by using computational techniques along with auxiliary information, such as a reference species tree or sequencing data. However, gene trees and species trees can differ as a result of gene duplication and loss (GDL), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and other biological processes. Thus gene tree correction methods need to take estimation error as well as gene tree heterogeneity into account. Many prior gene tree correction methods have been developed for the case where GDL is present. Here, we study the problem of gene tree correction where gene tree heterogeneity is instead due to ILS and/or HGT. We introduce TRACTION, a simple polynomial time method that provably finds an optimal solution to the RF-optimal tree refinement and completion (RF-OTRC) Problem, which seeks a refinement and completion of a singly-labeled gene tree with respect to a given singly-labeled species tree so as to minimize the Robinson−Foulds (RF) distance. Our extensive simulation study on 68,000 estimated gene trees shows that TRACTION matches or improves on the accuracy of well-established methods from the GDL literature when HGT and ILS are both present, and ties for best under the ILS-only conditions. Furthermore, TRACTION ties for fastest on these datasets. We also show that a naive generalization of the RF-OTRC problem to multi-labeled trees is possible, but can produce misleading results where gene tree heterogeneity is due to GDL. \\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

These genome-wide optical maps are assembled using an overlap-layout-consensus approach using raw optical map data, which are referred to as Rmaps. Due to the high error-rate of Rmap data, finding the overlap between Rmaps remains challenging. We present KOHDISTA, which is an index-based algorithm for finding pairwise alignments between single molecule maps (Rmaps). The novelty of our approach is the formulation of the alignment problem as automaton path matching, and the application of modern index-based data structures. In particular, we combine the use of the Generalized Compressed Suffix Array (GCSA) index with the wavelet tree in order to build KOHDISTA. We validate KOHDISTA on simulated E. coli data, showing the approach successfully finds alignments between Rmaps simulated from overlapping genomic regions. we demonstrate KOHDISTA is the only method that is capable of finding a significant number of high quality pairwise Rmap alignments for large eukaryote organisms in reasonable time.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

An intuitive way of doing this is to perform a modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), where only adjacent clusters (according to the ordering of positions within a chromosome) are allowed to be merged. But a major practical drawback of this method is its quadratic time and space complexity in the number of loci, which is typically of the order of 104 to 105 for each chromosome. By assuming that the similarity between physically distant objects is negligible, we are able to propose an implementation of adjacency-constrained HAC with quasi-linear complexity. This is achieved by pre-calculating specific sums of similarities, and storing candidate fusions in a min-heap. Our illustrations on GWAS and Hi-C datasets demonstrate the relevance of this assumption, and show that this method highlights biologically meaningful signals. Thanks to its small time and memory footprint, the method can be run on a standard laptop in minutes or even seconds. Software and sample data are available as an R package, adjclust, that can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Super short operations on both gene order and intergenic sizes\\n\\nThe evolutionary distance between two genomes can be estimated by computing a minimum length sequence of operations, called genome rearrangements, that transform one genome into another. Usually, a genome is modeled as an ordered sequence of genes, and most of the studies in the genome rearrangement literature consist in shaping biological scenarios into mathematical models. For instance, allowing different genome rearrangements operations at the same time, adding constraints to these rearrangements (e.g., each rearrangement can affect at most a given number of genes), considering that a rearrangement implies a cost depending on its length rather than a unit cost, etc. Most of the works, however, have overlooked some important features inside genomes, such as the presence of sequences of nucleotides between genes, called intergenic regions.\\nIn this work, we investigate the problem of computing the distance between two genomes, taking into account both gene order and intergenic sizes. The genome rearrangement operations we consider here are constrained types of reversals and transpositions, called super short reversals (SSRs) and super short transpositions (SSTs), which affect up to two (consecutive) genes. We denote by super short operations (SSOs) any SSR or SST. We show 3-approximation algorithms when the orientation of the genes is not considered when we allow SSRs, SSTs, or SSOs, and 5-approximation algorithms when considering the orientation for either SSRs or SSOs. We also show that these algorithms improve their approximation factors when the input permutation has a higher number of inversions, where the approximation factor decreases from 3 to either 2 or 1.5, and from 5 to either 3 or 2.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

A recently introduced approach to perform Forward–Backward Gibbs sampling using dynamic Haar wavelet compression has alleviated issues of convergence and, to some extent, speed. Yet, the problem remains challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithmic framework for this approach. We provide new space-efficient data structures to query sufficient statistics in logarithmic time, based on a linear-time, in-place transform of the data, which also improves on the compression ratio. We also propose a new approach to efficiently store and update marginal state counts obtained from the Gibbs sampler. Using this approach, we discover several CNV candidates in two rat populations divergently selected for tame and aggressive behavior, consistent with earlier results concerning the domestication syndrome as well as experimental observations. Computationally, we observe a 29.5-fold decrease in memory, an average 5.8-fold speedup, as well as a 191-fold decrease in minor page faults. We also observe that metrics varied greatly in the old implementation, but not the new one. We conjecture that this is due to the better compression scheme. The fully Bayesian segmentation of the entire WGS data set required 3.5 min and 1.24 GB of memory, and can hence be performed on a commodity laptop.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Implications of non-uniqueness in phylogenetic deconvolution of bulk DNA samples of tumors\\n\\nTumors exhibit extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity, the presence of groups of cellular populations with distinct sets of somatic mutations. This heterogeneity is the result of an evolutionary process, described by a phylogenetic tree. In addition to enabling clinicians to devise patient-specific treatment plans, phylogenetic trees of tumors enable researchers to decipher the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the problem of reconstructing a phylogenetic tree T given bulk sequencing data from a tumor is more complicated than the classic phylogeny inference problem. Rather than observing the leaves of T directly, we are given mutation frequencies that are the result of mixtures of the leaves of T. The majority of current tumor phylogeny inference methods employ the perfect phylogeny evolutionary model. The underlying PERFECT PHYLOGENY MIXTURE (PPM) combinatorial problem typically has multiple solutions.\\nWe prove that determining the exact number of solutions to the PPM problem is #P-complete and hard to approximate within a constant factor. Moreover, we show that sampling solutions uniformly at random is hard as well. On the positive side, we provide a polynomial-time computable upper bound on the number of solutions and introduce a simple rejection-sampling based scheme that works well for small instances. Using simulated and real data, we identify factors that contribute to and counteract non-uniqueness of solutions. In addition, we study the sampling performance of current methods, identifying significant biases.\\nAwareness of non-uniqueness of solutions to the PPM problem is key to drawing accurate conclusions in downstream analyses based on tumor phylogenies. This work provides the theoretical foundations for non-uniqueness of solutions in tumor phylogeny inference from bulk DNA samples.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

We derive the mixture of distributions of sequence similarity for duplicate gene pairs generated by repeated episodes of whole gene doubling. This involves integrating sequence divergence and gene pair loss through fractionation, using a branching process and a mutational model. We account not only for the timing of these events in terms of local modes, but also the amplitude and variance of the component distributions. This model is then extended to orthologous gene pairs. We apply the model and inference procedures to the evolution of the Solanaceae, focusing on the genomes of economically important crops. We assess how consistent or variable fractionation rates are from species to species and over time.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

In a clonal tree, each vertex represents a specific tumor clone, and is labeled with one or more mutations in a way that each mutation is assigned to the oldest clone that harbors it. Given two clonal trees, our multi-labeled tree dissimilarity (MLTD) measure is defined as the minimum number of mutation/label deletions, (empty) leaf deletions, and vertex (clonal) expansions, applied in any order, to convert each of the two trees to the maximum common tree. We show that the MLTD measure can be computed efficiently in polynomial time and it captures the similarity between trees of different clonal granularity well.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Among these, one of the most intractable ones has been that of finding the median of three genomes, a special case of the ancestral reconstruction problem. In this work we re-examine our recently proposed way of measuring genome rearrangement distance, namely, the rank distance between the matrix representations of the corresponding genomes, and show that the median of three genomes can be computed exactly in polynomial time O(nω), where ω≤3, with respect to this distance, when the median is allowed to be an arbitrary orthogonal matrix. We define the five fundamental subspaces depending on three input genomes, and use their properties to show that a particular action on each of these subspaces produces a median. In the process we introduce the notion of M-stable subspaces. We also show that the median found by our algorithm is always orthogonal, symmetric, and conserves any adjacencies or telomeres present in at least 2 out of 3 input genomes. We test our method on both simulated and real data. We find that the majority of the realistic inputs result in genomic outputs, and for those that do not, our two heuristics perform well in terms of reconstructing a genomic matrix attaining a score close to the lower bound, while running in a reasonable amount of time. We conclude that the rank distance is not only theoretically intriguing, but also practically useful for median-finding, and potentially ancestral genome reconstruction.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

We show how to compute solutions to general instances of φ-MCPS, given an algorithm to compute φ-MCPS on a circular genome with exactly one occurrence of each gene. These general instances can have an arbitrary number of circular and linear chromosomes, and arbitrary gene content. The practicality of the framework is displayed by presenting polynomial-time algorithms that generalize the results of Bulteau, Fertin, and Tannier on the SORTING BY WDCJS AND INDELS IN INTERGENES problem, and that generalize previous results on the MINIMUM LOCAL PARSIMONIOUS SCENARIO problem.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Evolution through segmental duplications and losses: a Super-Reconciliation approach\\n\\nThe classical gene and species tree reconciliation, used to infer the history of gene gain and loss explaining the evolution of gene families, assumes an independent evolution for each family. While this assumption is reasonable for genes that are far apart in the genome, it is not appropriate for genes grouped into syntenic blocks, which are more plausibly the result of a concerted evolution. Here, we introduce the Super-Reconciliation problem which consists in inferring a history of segmental duplication and loss events (involving a set of neighboring genes) leading to a set of present-day syntenies from a single ancestral one. In other words, we extend the traditional Duplication-Loss reconciliation problem of a single gene tree, to a set of trees, accounting for segmental duplications and losses. Existency of a Super-Reconciliation depends on individual gene tree consistency. In addition, ignoring rearrangements implies that existency also depends on gene order consistency. We first show that the problem of reconstructing a most parsimonious Super-Reconciliation, if any, is NP-hard and give an exact exponential-time algorithm to solve it. Alternatively, we show that accounting for rearrangements in the evolutionary model, but still only minimizing segmental duplication and loss events, leads to an exact polynomial-time algorithm. We finally assess time efficiency of the former exponential time algorithm for the Duplication-Loss model on simulated datasets, and give a proof of concept on the opioid receptor genes.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

We formally define the associated computational problem and show that the problem is NP-hard. We propose a novel and efficient algorithm, called DAMOKLE, to identify differentially mutated subnetworks given genome-wide mutation data for two sets of cancer samples. We prove that DAMOKLE identifies subnetworks with statistically significant difference in mutation frequency when the data comes from a reasonable generative model, provided enough samples are available. We test DAMOKLE on simulated and real data, showing that DAMOKLE does indeed find subnetworks with significant differences in mutation frequency and that it provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease not revealed by standard methods.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

These models may become inconsistent as new data become available and need to be repaired. In the past, the focus has been shed on the inference of (classes of) models given an interaction network and time-series data sets. However, repair of existing models against new data is still in its infancy, where the process is still manually performed and therefore slow and prone to errors. In this work, we propose a method with an associated tool to suggest repairs over inconsistent Boolean models, based on a set of atomic repair operations. Answer Set Programming is used to encode the minimal repair problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. In particular, given an inconsistent model, the tool provides the minimal repairs that render the model capable of generating dynamics coherent with a (set of) time-series data set(s), considering either a synchronous or an asynchronous updating scheme. The method was validated using known biological models from different species, as well as synthetic models obtained from randomly generated networks.

Due to the high error rates and less mature tools, de novo assembly of long reads is still challenging and often results in a large collection of contigs. Dense linkage maps are collections of markers whose location on the genome is approximately known. Therefore they provide long range information that has the potential to greatly aid in de novo assembly. Previously linkage maps have been used to detect misassemblies and to manually order contigs. However, no fully automated tools exist to incorporate linkage maps in assembly but instead large amounts of manual labour is needed to order the contigs into chromosomes. We formulate the genome assembly problem in the presence of linkage maps and present the first method for guided genome assembly using linkage maps. Our method is based on an additional cleaning step added to the assembly. We show that it can simplify the underlying assembly graph, resulting in more contiguous assemblies and reducing the amount of misassemblies when compared to de novo assembly. We present the first method to integrate linkage maps directly into genome assembly. With a modest increase in runtime, our method improves contiguity and correctness of genome assembly.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Many existing approaches reconcile each gene tree independently. However, it is well-known that the evolution of gene families is interconnected. In this paper, we extend a previous approach to reconcile a set of gene trees with a species tree based on segmental macro-evolutionary events, where segmental duplication events and losses are associated with cost δ and λ, respectively. We show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when δ≤λ (via LCA-mapping), while if δ>λ the problem is NP-hard, even when λ=0 and a single gene tree is given, solving a long standing open problem on the complexity of multi-gene reconciliation. On the positive side, we give a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem, where the parameters are δ/λ and the number d of segmental duplications, of time complexity O(⌈δλ⌉d⋅n⋅δλ). Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm on two previously studied real datasets: we first show that our method can be used to confirm or raise doubt on hypothetical segmental duplications on a set of 16 eukaryotes, then show how we can detect whole genome duplications in yeast genomes.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Connectivity problems on heterogeneous graphs\\n\\nNetwork connectivity problems are abundant in computational biology research, where graphs are used to represent a range of phenomena: from physical interactions between molecules to more abstract relationships such as gene co-expression. One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner Network problems: given a reference “database” graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands. While this formulation proved useful in a number of instances, the next challenge is to account for the fact that the reference graph may not be static. This can happen for instance, when studying protein measurements in single cells or at different time points, whereby different subsets of conditions can have different protein milieu. We introduce the condition Steiner Network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition. We show that introducing multiple conditions as an additional factor makes this problem much harder to approximate. Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C−ϵ, for every C≥2 and ϵ>0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver. Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

In this view, there is a growing interest in alignment-free and reference-free variants calling methods that only make use of (suitably indexed) raw reads data. We develop the positional clustering theory that (i) describes how the extended Burrows–Wheeler Transform (eBWT) of a collection of reads tends to cluster together bases that cover the same genome position (ii) predicts the size of such clusters, and (iii) exhibits an elegant and precise LCP array based procedure to locate such clusters in the eBWT. Based on this theory, we designed and implemented an alignment-free and reference-free SNPs calling method, and we devised a consequent SNPs calling pipeline. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that SNPs can be detected with a simple scan of the eBWT and LCP arrays as, in accordance with our theoretical framework, they are within clusters in the eBWT of the reads. Finally, our tool intrinsically performs a reference-free evaluation of its accuracy by returning the coverage of each SNP. Based on the results of the experiments on synthetic and real data, we conclude that the positional clustering framework can be effectively used for the problem of identifying SNPs, and it appears to be a promising approach for calling other type of variants directly on raw sequencing data. \\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

While there has been a large literature on AFC methods, the best in terms of empirical performance was DCMNJ, published in SODA 2001. The main empirical advantage of DCMNJ over other AFC methods is its use of neighbor joining (NJ) to construct trees on smaller taxon subsets, which are then combined into a tree on the full set of species using a supertree method; in contrast, the other AFC methods in essence depend on quartet trees that are computed independently of each other, which reduces accuracy compared to neighbor joining. However, DCMNJ is unlikely to scale to large datasets due to its reliance on supertree methods, as no current supertree methods are able to scale to large datasets with high accuracy. In this study we present a new approach to large-scale phylogeny estimation that shares some of the features of DCMNJ but bypasses the use of supertree methods. We prove that this new approach is AFC and uses polynomial time and space. Furthermore, we describe variations on this basic approach that can be used with leaf-disjoint constraint trees (computed using methods such as maximum likelihood) to produce other methods that are likely to provide even better accuracy. Thus, we present a new generalizable technique for large-scale tree estimation that is designed to improve scalability for phylogeny estimation methods to ultra-large datasets, and that can be used in a variety of settings (including tree estimation from unaligned sequences, and species tree estimation from gene trees).\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Here we present a procedure to efficiently, reliably and automatically assign partial atomic charges to atoms based on known distributions. We formally introduce the molecular charge assignment problem, where the task is to select a charge from a set of candidate charges for every atom of a given query molecule. Charges are accompanied by a score that depends on their observed frequency in similar neighbourhoods (chemical environments) in a database of previously parameterised molecules. The aim is to assign the charges such that the total charge equals a known target charge within a margin of error while maximizing the sum of the charge scores. We show that the problem is a variant of the well-studied multiple-choice knapsack problem and thus weakly NP-complete. We propose solutions based on Integer Linear Programming and a pseudo-polynomial time Dynamic Programming algorithm. We demonstrate that the results obtained for novel molecules not included in the database are comparable to the ones obtained performing explicit charge calculations while decreasing the time to determine partial charges for a molecule from hours or even days to below a second.

Functional genomics experiments extend their potential. They typically generate sequence lists ranked by an experimentally acquired functional property such as gene expression or protein binding affinity. Current motif discovery tools suffer from limitations in searching large motif spaces, and thus more complex motifs may not be included. There is thus a need for motif analysis methods that are tailored for analyzing specific complex motifs motivated by biological questions and hypotheses rather than acting as a screen based motif finding tool. We present Regmex (REGular expression Motif EXplorer), which offers several methods to identify overrepresented motifs in ranked lists of sequences. Regmex uses regular expressions to define motifs or families of motifs and embedded Markov models to calculate exact p-values for motif observations in sequences. Biases in motif distributions across ranked sequence lists are evaluated using random walks, Brownian bridges, or modified rank based statistics. A modular setup and fast analytic p value evaluations make Regmex applicable to diverse and potentially large-scale motif analysis problems. We demonstrate use cases of combined motifs on simulated data and on expression data from micro RNA transfection experiments. We confirm previously obtained results and demonstrate the usability of Regmex to test a specific hypothesis about the relative location of microRNA seed sites and U-rich motifs. We further compare the tool with an existing motif discovery tool and show increased sensitivity. Regmex is a useful and flexible tool to analyze motif hypotheses that relates to large data sets in functional genomics.

Efficient algorithms for the enumeration of superbubbles are therefore of important for the processing of HTS data. Superbubbles can be identified within the strongly connected components of the input digraph after transforming them into directed acyclic graphs. The algorithm by Sung et al. (IEEE ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform 12:770–777, 2015) achieves this task in O(m log(m))-time. The extraction of superbubbles from the transformed components was later improved to by Brankovic et al. (Theor Comput Sci 609:374–383, 2016) resulting in an overall O(m+n)-time algorithm. A re-analysis of the mathematical structure of superbubbles showed that the construction of auxiliary DAGs from the strongly connected components in the work of Sung et al. missed some details that can lead to the reporting of false positive superbubbles. We propose an alternative, even simpler auxiliary graph that solved the problem and retains the linear running time for general digraph. Furthermore, we describe a simpler, space-efficient O(m+n)-time algorithm for detecting superbubbles in DAGs that uses only simple data structures.

To address these concerns, this paper presents pClay, the first algorithm to perform parallel and arbitrarily precise comparisons of molecular surfaces and electrostatic isopotentials as geometric solids. pClay was presented at the 2019 Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI 2019) and is described in expanded detail here, especially with regard to the comparison of electrostatic isopotentials. Earlier methods have generally used parallelism to enhance computational throughput, pClay is the first algorithm to use parallelism to make arbitrarily high precision comparisons practical. It is also the first method to demonstrate that high precision comparisons of geometric solids can yield more precise structural inferences than algorithms that use existing standards of precision. One advantage of added precision is that statistical models can be trained with more accurate data. Using structural data from an existing method, a model of steric variations between binding cavities can overlook 53% of authentic steric influences on specificity, whereas a model trained with data from pClay overlooks none. Our results also demonstrate the parallel performance of pClay on both workstation CPUs and a 61-core Xeon Phi. While slower on one core, additional processor cores rapidly outpaced single core performance and existing methods. Based on these results, it is clear that pClay has applications in the automatic explanation of binding mechanisms and in the rational design of protein binding preferences.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Coordinate systems for supergenomes\\n\\nGenome sequences and genome annotation data have become available at ever increasing rates in response to the rapid progress in sequencing technologies. As a consequence the demand for methods supporting comparative, evolutionary analysis is also growing. In particular, efficient tools to visualize-omics data simultaneously for multiple species are sorely lacking. A first and crucial step in this direction is the construction of a common coordinate system. Since genomes not only differ by rearrangements but also by large insertions, deletions, and duplications, the use of a single reference genome is insufficient, in particular when the number of species becomes large. The computational problem then becomes to determine an order and orientations of optimal local alignments that are as co-linear as possible with all the genome sequences. We first review the most prominent approaches to model the problem formally and then proceed to showing that it can be phrased as a particular variant of the BETWEENNESS PROBLEM. It is NP hard in general. As exact solutions are beyond reach for the problem sizes of practical interest, we introduce a collection of heuristic simplifiers to resolve ordering conflicts. Benchmarks on real-life data ranging from bacterial to fly genomes demonstrate the feasibility of computing good common coordinate systems.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Improved de novo peptide sequencing using LC retention time information\\n\\nLiquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry is an important tool in proteomics for peptide identification. Liquid chromatography temporally separates the peptides in a sample. The peptides that elute one after another are analyzed via tandem mass spectrometry by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of a peptide and its fragments. De novo peptide sequencing is the problem of reconstructing the amino acid sequences of a peptide from this measurement data. Past de novo sequencing algorithms solely consider the mass spectrum of the fragments for reconstructing a sequence. We propose to additionally exploit the information obtained from liquid chromatography. We study the problem of computing a sequence that is not only in accordance with the experimental mass spectrum, but also with the chromatographic retention time. We consider three models for predicting the retention time and develop algorithms for de novo sequencing for each model. Based on an evaluation for two prediction models on experimental data from synthesized peptides we conclude that the identification rates are improved by exploiting the chromatographic information. In our evaluation, we compare our algorithms using the retention time information with algorithms using the same scoring model, but not the retention time.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Sorting signed circular permutations by super short operations\\n\\nOne way to estimate the evolutionary distance between two given genomes is to determine the minimum number of large-scale mutations, or genome rearrangements, that are necessary to transform one into the other. In this context, genomes can be represented as ordered sequences of genes, each gene being represented by a signed integer. If no gene is repeated, genomes are thus modeled as signed permutations of the form \\\\pi =(\\\\pi _1 \\\\pi _2 \\\\ldots \\\\pi _n), and in that case we can consider without loss of generality that one of them is the identity permutation \\\\iota _n =(1 2 \\\\ldots n), and that we just need to sort the other (i.e., transform it into \\\\iota _n). The most studied genome rearrangement events are reversals, where a segment of the genome is reversed and reincorporated at the same location; and transpositions, where two consecutive segments are exchanged. Many variants, e.g., combining different types of (possibly constrained) rearrangements, have been proposed in the literature. One of them considers that the number of genes involved, in a reversal or a transposition, is never greater than two, which is known as the problem of sorting by super short operations (or SSOs). All problems considering SSOs in permutations have been shown to be in P, except for one, namely sorting signed circular permutations by super short reversals and super short transpositions. Here we fill this gap by introducing a new graph structure called cyclic permutation graph and providing a series of intermediate results, which allows us to design a polynomial algorithm for sorting signed circular permutations by super short reversals and super short transpositions.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Here we show that gap patterns in large-scale, genome-wide alignments are themselves phylogenetically informative and can be used to infer reliable phylogenies provided the gap data are properly filtered to reduce noise introduced by the alignment method. We introduce here the notion of split-inducing indels (splids) that define an approximate bipartition of the taxon set. We show both in simulated data and in case studies on real-life data that splids can be efficiently extracted from phylogenomic data sets. Suitably processed gap patterns extracted from genome-wide alignment provide a surprisingly clear phylogenetic signal and an allow the inference of accurate phylogenetic trees.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Several approaches to HGT inference have been proposed. However, most of them either rely on approximate, non-phylogenetic methods or on the tree reconciliation, which is computationally intensive and sensitive to parameter values. We investigate the locus tree inference problem as a possible alternative that combines the advantages of both approaches. We present several algorithms to solve the problem in the parsimony framework. We introduce a novel tree mapping, which allows us to obtain a heuristic solution to the problems of locus tree inference and duplication classification. Our approach allows for faster comparisons of gene and species trees and improves known algorithms for duplication inference in the presence of polytomies in the species trees.

Most of the current methodologies for haplotype assembly are designed for diploid individuals. In recent years, genomes having more than two sets of homologous chromosomes have attracted many research groups that are interested in the genomics of disease, phylogenetics, botany and evolution. However, there is still a lack of methods for reconstructing polyploid haplotypes. In this work, the minimum error correction with genotype information (MEC/GI) model, an important combinatorial model for haplotyping a single individual, is used to study the triploid individual haplotype reconstruction problem. A fast and accurate enumeration-based algorithm enumeration haplotyping triploid with least difference (EHTLD) is proposed for solving the MEC/GI model. The EHTLD algorithm tries to reconstruct the three haplotypes according to the order of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci along them. When reconstructing a given SNP site, the EHTLD algorithm enumerates three kinds of SNP values in terms of the corresponding site’s genotype value, and chooses the one, which leads to the minimum difference between the reconstructed haplotypes and the sequenced fragments covering that SNP site, to fill the SNP loci being reconstructed. Extensive experimental comparisons were performed between the EHTLD algorithm and the well known HapCompass and HapTree. Compared with algorithms HapCompass and HapTree, the EHTLD algorithm can reconstruct more accurate haplotypes, which were proven by a number of experiments.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Finding local genome rearrangements\\n\\nThe double cut and join (DCJ) model of genome rearrangement is well studied due to its mathematical simplicity and power to account for the many events that transform gene order. These studies have mostly been devoted to the understanding of minimum length scenarios transforming one genome into another. In this paper we search instead for rearrangement scenarios that minimize the number of rearrangements whose breakpoints are unlikely due to some biological criteria. One such criterion has recently become accessible due to the advent of the Hi-C experiment, facilitating the study of 3D spacial distance between breakpoint regions. We establish a link between the minimum number of unlikely rearrangements required by a scenario and the problem of finding a maximum edge-disjoint cycle packing on a certain transformed version of the adjacency graph. This link leads to a 3/2-approximation as well as an exact integer linear programming formulation for our problem, which we prove to be NP-complete. We also present experimental results on fruit flies, showing that Hi-C data is informative when used as a criterion for rearrangements. A new variant of the weighted DCJ distance problem is addressed that ignores scenario length in its objective function. A solution to this problem provides a lower bound on the number of unlikely moves necessary when transforming one gene order into another. This lower bound aids in the study of rearrangement scenarios with respect to chromatin structure, and could eventually be used in the design of a fixed parameter algorithm with a more general objective function.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'FSH: fast spaced seed hashing exploiting adjacent hashes\\n\\nPatterns with wildcards in specified positions, namely spaced seeds, are increasingly used instead of k-mers in many bioinformatics applications that require indexing, querying and rapid similarity search, as they can provide better sensitivity. Many of these applications require to compute the hashing of each position in the input sequences with respect to the given spaced seed, or to multiple spaced seeds. While the hashing of k-mers can be rapidly computed by exploiting the large overlap between consecutive k-mers, spaced seeds hashing is usually computed from scratch for each position in the input sequence, thus resulting in slower processing. The method proposed in this paper, fast spaced-seed hashing (FSH), exploits the similarity of the hash values of spaced seeds computed at adjacent positions in the input sequence. In our experiments we compute the hash for each positions of metagenomics reads from several datasets, with respect to different spaced seeds. We also propose a generalized version of the algorithm for the simultaneous computation of multiple spaced seeds hashing. In the experiments, our algorithm can compute the hashing values of spaced seeds with a speedup, with respect to the traditional approach, between 1.6× to 5.3×, depending on the structure of the spaced seed. Spaced seed hashing is a routine task for several bioinformatics application. FSH allows to perform this task efficiently and raise the question of whether other hashing can be exploited to further improve the speed up. This has the potential of major impact in the field, making spaced seed applications not only accurate, but also faster and more efficient.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Outlier detection in BLAST hits\\n\\nAn important task in a metagenomic analysis is the assignment of taxonomic labels to sequences in a sample. Most widely used methods for taxonomy assignment compare a sequence in the sample to a database of known sequences. Many approaches use the best BLAST hit(s) to assign the taxonomic label. However, it is known that the best BLAST hit may not always correspond to the best taxonomic match. An alternative approach involves phylogenetic methods, which take into account alignments and a model of evolution in order to more accurately define the taxonomic origin of sequences. Similarity-search based methods typically run faster than phylogenetic methods and work well when the organisms in the sample are well represented in the database. In contrast, phylogenetic methods have the capability to identify new organisms in a sample but are computationally quite expensive. We propose a two-step approach for metagenomic taxon identification; i.e., use a rapid method that accurately classifies sequences using a reference database (this is a filtering step) and then use a more complex phylogenetic method for the sequences that were unclassified in the previous step. In this work, we explore whether and when using top BLAST hit(s) yields a correct taxonomic label. We develop a method to detect outliers among BLAST hits in order to separate the phylogenetically most closely related matches from matches to sequences from more distantly related organisms. We used modified BILD (Bayesian Integral Log-Odds) scores, a multiple-alignment scoring function, to define the outliers within a subset of top BLAST hits and assign taxonomic labels. We compared the accuracy of our method to the RDP classifier and show that our method yields fewer misclassifications while properly classifying organisms that are not present in the database. Finally, we evaluated the use of our method as a pre-processing step before more expensive phylogenetic analyses (in our case TIPP) in the context of real 16S rRNA datasets. Our experiments make a good case for using a two-step approach for accurate taxonomic assignment. We show that our method can be used as a filtering step before using phylogenetic methods and provides a way to interpret BLAST results using more information than provided by E-values and bit-scores alone.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'OCTAL: Optimal Completion of gene trees in polynomial time\\n\\nFor a combination of reasons (including data generation protocols, approaches to taxon and gene sampling, and gene birth and loss), estimated gene trees are often incomplete, meaning that they do not contain all of the species of interest. As incomplete gene trees can impact downstream analyses, accurate completion of gene trees is desirable. We introduce the Optimal Tree Completion problem, a general optimization problem that involves completing an unrooted binary tree (i.e., adding missing leaves) so as to minimize its distance from a reference tree on a superset of the leaves. We present OCTAL, an algorithm that finds an optimal solution to this problem when the distance between trees is defined using the Robinson–Foulds (RF) distance, and we prove that OCTAL runs in O(n2) time, where n is the total number of species. We report on a simulation study in which gene trees can differ from the species tree due to incomplete lineage sorting, and estimated gene trees are completed using OCTAL with a reference tree based on a species tree estimated from the multi-locus dataset. OCTAL produces completed gene trees that are closer to the true gene trees than an existing heuristic approach in ASTRAL-II, but the accuracy of a completed gene tree computed by OCTAL depends on how topologically similar the reference tree (typically an estimated species tree) is to the true gene tree. OCTAL is a useful technique for adding missing taxa to incomplete gene trees and provides good accuracy under a wide range of model conditions. However, results show that OCTAL’s accuracy can be reduced when incomplete lineage sorting is high, as the reference tree can be far from the true gene tree. Hence, this study suggests that OCTAL would benefit from using other types of reference trees instead of species trees when there are large topological distances between true gene trees and species trees.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'The distance and median problems in the single-cut-or-join model with single-gene duplications\\n\\nIn the field of genome rearrangement algorithms, models accounting for gene duplication lead often to hard problems. For example, while computing the pairwise distance is tractable in most duplication-free models, the problem is NP-complete for most extensions of these models accounting for duplicated genes. Moreover, problems involving more than two genomes, such as the genome median and the Small Parsimony problem, are intractable for most duplication-free models, with some exceptions, for example the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) model. We introduce a variant of the SCJ distance that accounts for duplicated genes, in the context of directed evolution from an ancestral genome to a descendant genome where orthology relations between ancestral genes and their descendant are known. Our model includes two duplication mechanisms: single-gene tandem duplication and the creation of single-gene circular chromosomes. We prove that in this model, computing the directed distance and a parsimonious evolutionary scenario in terms of SCJ and single-gene duplication events can be done in linear time. We also show that the directed median problem is tractable for this distance, while the rooted median problem, where we assume that one of the given genomes is ancestral to the median, is NP-complete. We also describe an Integer Linear Program for solving this problem. We evaluate the directed distance and rooted median algorithms on simulated data. Our results provide a simple genome rearrangement model, extending the SCJ model to account for single-gene duplications, for which we prove a mix of tractability and hardness results. For the NP-complete rooted median problem, we design a simple Integer Linear Program. Our publicly available implementation of these algorithms for the directed distance and median problems allow to solve efficiently these problems on large instances.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Currently, cosine similarity and correlation coefficients are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear whether these functions are optimal for profile alignment methods. By definition, these functions cannot capture nonlinear relationships between profiles. Therefore, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was more suitable for the profile-comparison method than existing functions, using neural networks. Although neural networks required derivative-of-cost functions, the problem being addressed in this study lacked them. Therefore, we implemented a novel derivative-free neural network by combining a conventional neural network with an evolutionary strategy optimization method used as a solver. Using this novel neural network system, we optimized the scoring function to align remote sequence pairs. Our results showed that the pairwise-profile aligner using the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision relative to aligners using existing functions. We developed and implemented a novel derivative-free neural network and aligner (Nepal) for optimizing sequence alignments. Nepal improved alignment quality by adapting to remote sequence alignments and increasing the expressiveness of similarity scores. Additionally, this novel scoring function can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into other aligners. Moreover our scoring function could potentially improve the performance of homology detection and/or multiple-sequence alignment of remote homologous sequences. The goal of the study was to provide a novel scoring function for profile alignment method and develop a novel learning system capable of addressing derivative-free problems. Our system is capable of optimizing the performance of other sophisticated methods and solving problems without derivative-of-cost functions, which do not always exist in practical problems. Our results demonstrated the usefulness of this optimization method for derivative-free problems.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Sequence-based typing methods are a gold standard for epidemiological surveillance due to the inherent portability of sequence and allelic profile data, fast analysis times and their capacity to create common nomenclatures for strains or clones. This led to development of several novel methods and several databases being made available for many microbial species. With the mainstream use of High Throughput Sequencing, the amount of data being accumulated in these databases is huge, storing thousands of different profiles. On the other hand, computing genetic evolutionary distances among a set of typing profiles or taxa dominates the running time of many phylogenetic inference methods. It is important also to note that most of genetic evolution distance definitions rely, even if indirectly, on computing the pairwise Hamming distance among sequences or profiles. We propose here an average-case linear-time algorithm to compute pairwise Hamming distances among a set of taxa under a given Hamming distance threshold. This article includes both a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results concerning the proposed algorithm. We further show how this algorithm can be successfully integrated into a well known phylogenetic inference method, and how it can be used to speedup querying local phylogenetic patterns over large typing databases.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Metagenomic assembly is a variant of the problem asking to reconstruct the circular genomes of all bacterial species present in a sequencing sample. This problem can be naturally formulated as finding a collection of circular walks of a directed graph G that together cover all nodes, or edges, of G. We address this problem with the “safe and complete” framework of Tomescu and Medvedev (Research in computational Molecular biology—20th annual conference, RECOMB 9649:152–163, 2016). An algorithm is called safe if it returns only those walks (also called safe) that appear as subwalk in all metagenomic assembly solutions for G. A safe algorithm is called complete if it returns all safe walks of G. We give graph-theoretic characterizations of the safe walks of G, and a safe and complete algorithm finding all safe walks of G. In the node-covering case, our algorithm runs in time O(m2+n3), and in the edge-covering case it runs in time O(m2n); n and m denote the number of nodes and edges, respectively, of G. This algorithm constitutes the first theoretical tight upper bound on what can be safely assembled from metagenomic reads using this problem formulation.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Knowledge of the event labels considerably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species trees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the event types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled case may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here we investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation problem with horizontal transfer. We investigate the issue of time-consistency for the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a convenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of time-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak conditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which evolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an O(|V(T)|log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent reconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit timing maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking whether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic. The algorithms are implemented in C++ using the boost graph library and are freely available at https://github.com/Nojgaard/tc-recon. The combinatorial characterization of time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an important step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal transfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees. The fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context because it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree reconciliation problems.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

In its standard formulation, the objective is to find a species tree that minimizes the total number of gene duplications and losses with respect to the input set of gene trees. Although much is known about GTP, little is known about how to treat inputs containing some incomplete gene trees (i.e., gene trees lacking one or more of the species). We present new theory for GTP considering whether the incompleteness is due to gene birth and death (i.e., true biological loss) or taxon sampling, and present dynamic programming algorithms that can be used for an exact but exponential time solution for small numbers of taxa, or as a heuristic for larger numbers of taxa. We also prove that the “standard” calculations for duplications and losses exactly solve GTP when incompleteness results from taxon sampling, although they can be incorrect when incompleteness results from true biological loss.

In this article we present and analyze eGSA [introduced in CPM (External memory generalized suffix and LCP arrays construction. In: Proceedings of CPM. pp 201–10, 2013)], the first external memory algorithm to construct generalized suffix arrays augmented with the longest common prefix array for a string collection.

On real datasets of size up to 24 GB and using 2 GB of internal memory, eGSA showed a competitive performance when compared to eSAIS and SAscan, which are efficient algorithms for a single string according to the related literature. We also show the effect of disk caching managed by the operating system on our algorithm.

When each protein is unique then the species name is sufficient to guide this match, however, when there are multiple related sequences (paralogs) in each species then the pairing is more difficult. In bacteria a good guide can be gained from genome co-location as interacting proteins tend to be in a common operon but in eukaryotes this simple principle is not sufficient. The methods developed in this paper take sets of paralogs for different proteins found in the same species and make a pairing based on their evolutionary distance relative to a set of other proteins that are unique and so have a known relationship (singletons). The former constitute a set of unlabelled nodes in a graph while the latter are labelled. Two variants were tested, one based on a phylogenetic tree of the sequences (the topology-based method) and a simpler, faster variant based only on the inter-sequence distances (the distance-based method). Over a set of test proteins, both gave good results, with the topology method performing slightly better. The methods develop here still need refinement and augmentation from constraints other than the sequence data alone, such as known interactions from annotation and databases, or non-trivial relationships in genome location. With the ever growing numbers of eukaryotic genomes, it is hoped that the methods described here will open a route to the use of these data equal to the current success attained with bacterial sequences.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

The question then arises as whether inferred event-labeled gene trees are biologically feasible, that is, if there is a possible true history that would explain a given gene tree. In practice, this problem is boiled down to finding a reconciliation map—also known as DTL-scenario—between the event-labeled gene trees and a (possibly unknown) species tree. In this contribution, we first characterize whether there is a valid reconciliation map for binary event-labeled gene trees T that contain speciation, duplication and horizontal gene transfer events and some unknown species tree S in terms of “informative” triples that are displayed in T and provide information of the topology of S. These informative triples are used to infer the unknown species tree S for T. We obtain a similar result for non-binary gene trees. To this end, however, the reconciliation map needs to be further restricted. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there is a species tree for a given event-labeled gene tree, and in the positive case, to construct the species tree and the respective (restricted) reconciliation map. However, informative triples as well as DTL-scenarios have their limitations when they are used to explain the biological feasibility of gene trees. While reconciliation maps imply biological feasibility, we show that the converse is not true in general. Moreover, we show that informative triples neither provide enough information to characterize “relaxed” DTL-scenarios nor non-restricted reconciliation maps for non-binary biologically feasible gene trees.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

In mitochondrial genomes different mechanisms are likely at work, at least some of which involve the duplication of sequence around the location of the apparent breakpoints. We hypothesize that these different mechanisms of genome rearrangement leave distinctive sequence footprints. In order to study such effects it is important to locate the breakpoint positions with precision. We define a partially local sequence alignment problem that assumes that following a rearrangement of a sequence F, two fragments L, and R are produced that may exactly fit together to match F, leave a gap of deleted DNA between L and R, or overlap with each other. We show that this alignment problem can be solved by dynamic programming in cubic space and time. We apply the new method to evaluate rearrangements of animal mitogenomes and find that a surprisingly large fraction of these events involved local sequence duplications. The partially local sequence alignment method is an effective way to investigate the mechanism of genomic rearrangement events. While applied here only to mitogenomes there is no reason why the method could not be used to also consider rearrangements in nuclear genomes.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",

Among the most widely used methods in this class is the standard bootstrap method, which consists of random sampling with replacement. While not requiring assumptions about any particular parametric model for resampling purposes, the bootstrap and related techniques assume that sites are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The i.i.d. assumption can be an over-simplification for many problems in computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular, sequential dependence within biomolecular sequences is often an essential biological feature due to biochemical function, evolutionary processes such as recombination, and other factors. To relax the simplifying i.i.d. assumption, we propose a new non-parametric/semi-parametric sequential resampling technique that generalizes “Heads-or-Tails” mirrored inputs, a simple but clever technique due to Landan and Graur. The generalized procedure takes the form of random walks along either aligned or unaligned biomolecular sequences. We refer to our new method as the SERES (or “SEquential RESampling”) method. To demonstrate the performance of the new technique, we apply SERES to estimate support for the multiple sequence alignment problem.

However, maximum likelihood parameter estimation with beta distributions suffers from problems because of singularities in the log-likelihood function if some observations take the values 0 or 1. While ad-hoc corrections have been proposed to mitigate this problem, we propose a different approach to parameter estimation for beta mixtures where such problems do not arise in the first place. Our algorithm combines latent variables with the method of moments instead of maximum likelihood, which has computational advantages over the popular EM algorithm. As an application, we demonstrate that methylation state classification is more accurate when using adaptive thresholds from beta mixtures than non-adaptive thresholds on observed methylation levels. We also demonstrate that we can accurately infer the number of mixture components. The hybrid algorithm between likelihood-based component un-mixing and moment-based parameter estimation is a robust and efficient method for beta mixture estimation.

The second problem arises when the two trees to be compared have only partially overlapping leaf sets. The traditional approach to handling these problems is to first restrict the two trees to their common leaf set. An alternative approach that has shown promise is to first complete the trees by adding missing leaves, so that the resulting trees have identical leaf sets. This requires the computation of an optimal completion that minimizes the distance between the two resulting trees over all possible completions.\\nWe provide optimal linear-time algorithms for both completion problems under the widely-used Robinson–Foulds (RF) distance measure. Our algorithm for the first problem improves the time complexity of the current fastest algorithm from quadratic (in the size of the two trees) to linear. No algorithms have yet been proposed for the more general second problem where both trees have missing leaves. We advance the study of this general problem by proposing a useful restricted version of the general problem and providing optimal linear-time algorithms for the restricted version. Our experimental results on biological data sets suggest that completion-based RF distances can be very different compared to traditional RF distances.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'From pairs of most similar sequences to phylogenetic best matches\\n\\nMany of the commonly used methods for orthology detection start from mutually most similar pairs of genes (reciprocal best hits) as an approximation for evolutionary most closely related pairs of genes (reciprocal best matches). This approximation of best matches by best hits becomes exact for ultrametric dissimilarities, i.e., under the Molecular Clock Hypothesis. It fails, however, whenever there are large lineage specific rate variations among paralogous genes. In practice, this introduces a high level of noise into the input data for best-hit-based orthology detection methods. If additive distances between genes are known, then evolutionary most closely related pairs can be identified by considering certain quartets of genes provided that in each quartet the outgroup relative to the remaining three genes is known. A priori knowledge of underlying species phylogeny greatly facilitates the identification of the required outgroup. Although the workflow remains a heuristic since the correct outgroup cannot be determined reliably in all cases, simulations with lineage specific biases and rate asymmetries show that nearly perfect results can be achieved. In a realistic setting, where distances data have to be estimated from sequence data and hence are noisy, it is still possible to obtain highly accurate sets of best matches.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'Alignment- and reference-free phylogenomics with colored de Bruijn graphs\\n\\nThe increasing amount of available genome sequence data enables large-scale comparative studies. A common task is the inference of phylogenies—a challenging task if close reference sequences are not available, genome sequences are incompletely assembled, or the high number of genomes precludes multiple sequence alignment in reasonable time. We present a new whole-genome based approach to infer phylogenies that is alignment- and reference-free. In contrast to other methods, it does not rely on pairwise comparisons to determine distances to infer edges in a tree. Instead, a colored de Bruijn graph is constructed, and information on common subsequences is extracted to infer phylogenetic splits. The introduced new methodology for large-scale phylogenomics shows high potential. Application to different datasets confirms robustness of the approach. A comparison to other state-of-the-art whole-genome based methods indicates comparable or higher accuracy and efficiency.\\n BREAKS HERE',\n",
              " 'GrpClassifierEC: a novel classification approach based on the ensemble clustering space\\n\\nAdvances in molecular biology have resulted in big and complicated data sets, therefore a clustering approach that able to capture the actual structure and the hidden patterns of the data is required. Moreover, the geometric space may not reflects the actual similarity between the different objects. As a result, in this research we use clustering-based space that convert the geometric space of the molecular to a categorical space based on clustering results. Then we use this space for developing a new classification algorithm. In this study, we propose a new classification method named GrpClassifierEC that replaces the given data space with categorical space based on ensemble clustering (EC). The EC space is defined by tracking the membership of the points over multiple runs of clustering algorithms. Different points that were included in the same clusters will be represented as a single point. Our algorithm classifies all these points as a single class. The similarity between two objects is defined as the number of times that these objects were not belong to the same cluster. In order to evaluate our suggested method, we compare its results to the k nearest neighbors, Decision tree and Random forest classification algorithms on several benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the suggested new algorithm GrpClassifierEC outperforms the other algorithms. Our algorithm can be integrated with many other algorithms. In this research, we use only the k-means clustering algorithm with different k values. In future research, we propose several directions: (1) checking the effect of the clustering algorithm to build an ensemble clustering space. (2) Finding poor clustering results based on the training data, (3) reducing the volume of the data by combining similar points based on the EC.\\n BREAKS HERE']"

            "Estimated gene trees are often inaccurate, due to insufficient phylogenetic signal in the single gene alignment, among other causes. Gene tree correction aims to improve the accuracy of an estimated gene tree by using computational techniques along with auxiliary information, such as a reference species tree or sequencing data. However, gene trees and species trees can differ as a result of gene duplication and loss (GDL), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and other biological processes. Thus gene tree correction methods need to take estimation error as well as gene tree heterogeneity into account. Many prior gene tree correction methods have been developed for the case where GDL is present. Here, we study the problem of gene tree correction where gene tree heterogeneity is instead due to ILS and/or HGT. We introduce TRACTION, a simple polynomial time method that provably finds an optimal solution to the RF-optimal tree refinement and completion (RF-OTRC) Problem, which seeks a refinement and completion of a singly-labeled gene tree with respect to a given singly-labeled species tree so as to minimize the Robinson−Foulds (RF) distance. Our extensive simulation study on 68,000 estimated gene trees shows that TRACTION matches or improves on the accuracy of well-established methods from the GDL literature when HGT and ILS are both present, and ties for best under the ILS-only conditions. Furthermore, TRACTION ties for fastest on these datasets. We also show that a naive generalization of the RF-OTRC problem to multi-labeled trees is possible, but can produce misleading results where gene tree heterogeneity is due to GDL. \n",

            "Genome-wide optical maps are ordered high-resolution restriction maps that give the position of occurrence of restriction cut sites corresponding to one or more restriction enzymes. These genome-wide optical maps are assembled using an overlap-layout-consensus approach using raw optical map data, which are referred to as Rmaps. Due to the high error-rate of Rmap data, finding the overlap between Rmaps remains challenging. We present KOHDISTA, which is an index-based algorithm for finding pairwise alignments between single molecule maps (Rmaps). The novelty of our approach is the formulation of the alignment problem as automaton path matching, and the application of modern index-based data structures. In particular, we combine the use of the Generalized Compressed Suffix Array (GCSA) index with the wavelet tree in order to build KOHDISTA. We validate KOHDISTA on simulated E. coli data, showing the approach successfully finds alignments between Rmaps simulated from overlapping genomic regions. we demonstrate KOHDISTA is the only method that is capable of finding a significant number of high quality pairwise Rmap alignments for large eukaryote organisms in reasonable time.\n",

            "\n",
            "Genomic data analyses such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or Hi-C studies are often faced with the problem of partitioning chromosomes into successive regions based on a similarity matrix of high-resolution, locus-level measurements. An intuitive way of doing this is to perform a modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), where only adjacent clusters (according to the ordering of positions within a chromosome) are allowed to be merged. But a major practical drawback of this method is its quadratic time and space complexity in the number of loci, which is typically of the order of 104 to 105 for each chromosome. By assuming that the similarity between physically distant objects is negligible, we are able to propose an implementation of adjacency-constrained HAC with quasi-linear complexity. This is achieved by pre-calculating specific sums of similarities, and storing candidate fusions in a min-heap. Our illustrations on GWAS and Hi-C datasets demonstrate the relevance of this assumption, and show that this method highlights biologically meaningful signals. Thanks to its small time and memory footprint, the method can be run on a standard laptop in minutes or even seconds. Software and sample data are available as an R package, adjclust, that can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).\n",

            "The evolutionary distance between two genomes can be estimated by computing a minimum length sequence of operations, called genome rearrangements, that transform one genome into another. Usually, a genome is modeled as an ordered sequence of genes, and most of the studies in the genome rearrangement literature consist in shaping biological scenarios into mathematical models. For instance, allowing different genome rearrangements operations at the same time, adding constraints to these rearrangements (e.g., each rearrangement can affect at most a given number of genes), considering that a rearrangement implies a cost depending on its length rather than a unit cost, etc. Most of the works, however, have overlooked some important features inside genomes, such as the presence of sequences of nucleotides between genes, called intergenic regions.\n",
            "In this work, we investigate the problem of computing the distance between two genomes, taking into account both gene order and intergenic sizes. The genome rearrangement operations we consider here are constrained types of reversals and transpositions, called super short reversals (SSRs) and super short transpositions (SSTs), which affect up to two (consecutive) genes. We denote by super short operations (SSOs) any SSR or SST. We show 3-approximation algorithms when the orientation of the genes is not considered when we allow SSRs, SSTs, or SSOs, and 5-approximation algorithms when considering the orientation for either SSRs or SSOs. We also show that these algorithms improve their approximation factors when the input permutation has a higher number of inversions, where the approximation factor decreases from 3 to either 2 or 1.5, and from 5 to either 3 or 2.\n",

            "Full Bayesian inference for detecting copy number variants (CNV) from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is still largely infeasible due to computational demands. A recently introduced approach to perform Forward–Backward Gibbs sampling using dynamic Haar wavelet compression has alleviated issues of convergence and, to some extent, speed. Yet, the problem remains challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithmic framework for this approach. We provide new space-efficient data structures to query sufficient statistics in logarithmic time, based on a linear-time, in-place transform of the data, which also improves on the compression ratio. We also propose a new approach to efficiently store and update marginal state counts obtained from the Gibbs sampler. Using this approach, we discover several CNV candidates in two rat populations divergently selected for tame and aggressive behavior, consistent with earlier results concerning the domestication syndrome as well as experimental observations. Computationally, we observe a 29.5-fold decrease in memory, an average 5.8-fold speedup, as well as a 191-fold decrease in minor page faults. We also observe that metrics varied greatly in the old implementation, but not the new one. We conjecture that this is due to the better compression scheme. The fully Bayesian segmentation of the entire WGS data set required 3.5 min and 1.24 GB of memory, and can hence be performed on a commodity laptop.\n",

            "Tumors exhibit extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity, the presence of groups of cellular populations with distinct sets of somatic mutations. This heterogeneity is the result of an evolutionary process, described by a phylogenetic tree. In addition to enabling clinicians to devise patient-specific treatment plans, phylogenetic trees of tumors enable researchers to decipher the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the problem of reconstructing a phylogenetic tree T given bulk sequencing data from a tumor is more complicated than the classic phylogeny inference problem. Rather than observing the leaves of T directly, we are given mutation frequencies that are the result of mixtures of the leaves of T. The majority of current tumor phylogeny inference methods employ the perfect phylogeny evolutionary model. The underlying PERFECT PHYLOGENY MIXTURE (PPM) combinatorial problem typically has multiple solutions.\n",

Moreover, we show that sampling solutions uniformly at random is hard as well. On the positive side, we provide a polynomial-time computable upper bound on the number of solutions and introduce a simple rejection-sampling based scheme that works well for small instances. Using simulated and real data, we identify factors that contribute to and counteract non-uniqueness of solutions. In addition, we study the sampling performance of current methods, identifying significant biases.\n",

We derive the mixture of distributions of sequence similarity for duplicate gene pairs generated by repeated episodes of whole gene doubling. This involves integrating sequence divergence and gene pair loss through fractionation, using a branching process and a mutational model. We account not only for the timing of these events in terms of local modes, but also the amplitude and variance of the component distributions. This model is then extended to orthologous gene pairs. We apply the model and inference procedures to the evolution of the Solanaceae, focusing on the genomes of economically important crops. We assess how consistent or variable fractionation rates are from species to species and over time.\n",

In a clonal tree, each vertex represents a specific tumor clone, and is labeled with one or more mutations in a way that each mutation is assigned to the oldest clone that harbors it. Given two clonal trees, our multi-labeled tree dissimilarity (MLTD) measure is defined as the minimum number of mutation/label deletions, (empty) leaf deletions, and vertex (clonal) expansions, applied in any order, to convert each of the two trees to the maximum common tree. We show that the MLTD measure can be computed efficiently in polynomial time and it captures the similarity between trees of different clonal granularity well.\n",

            "The area of genome rearrangements has given rise to a number of interesting biological, mathematical and algorithmic problems. Among these, one of the most intractable ones has been that of finding the median of three genomes, a special case of the ancestral reconstruction problem. In this work we re-examine our recently proposed way of measuring genome rearrangement distance, namely, the rank distance between the matrix representations of the corresponding genomes, and show that the median of three genomes can be computed exactly in polynomial time O(nω), where ω≤3, with respect to this distance, when the median is allowed to be an arbitrary orthogonal matrix. We define the five fundamental subspaces depending on three input genomes, and use their properties to show that a particular action on each of these subspaces produces a median. In the process we introduce the notion of M-stable subspaces. We also show that the median found by our algorithm is always orthogonal, symmetric, and conserves any adjacencies or telomeres present in at least 2 out of 3 input genomes. We test our method on both simulated and real data. We find that the majority of the realistic inputs result in genomic outputs, and for those that do not, our two heuristics perform well in terms of reconstructing a genomic matrix attaining a score close to the lower bound, while running in a reasonable amount of time. We conclude that the rank distance is not only theoretically intriguing, but also practically useful for median-finding, and potentially ancestral genome reconstruction.\n",

We show how to compute solutions to general instances of φ-MCPS, given an algorithm to compute φ-MCPS on a circular genome with exactly one occurrence of each gene. These general instances can have an arbitrary number of circular and linear chromosomes, and arbitrary gene content. The practicality of the framework is displayed by presenting polynomial-time algorithms that generalize the results of Bulteau, Fertin, and Tannier on the SORTING BY WDCJS AND INDELS IN INTERGENES problem, and that generalize previous results on the MINIMUM LOCAL PARSIMONIOUS SCENARIO problem.\n",

            "\n",
            "The classical gene and species tree reconciliation, used to infer the history of gene gain and loss explaining the evolution of gene families, assumes an independent evolution for each family. While this assumption is reasonable for genes that are far apart in the genome, it is not appropriate for genes grouped into syntenic blocks, which are more plausibly the result of a concerted evolution. Here, we introduce the Super-Reconciliation problem which consists in inferring a history of segmental duplication and loss events (involving a set of neighboring genes) leading to a set of present-day syntenies from a single ancestral one. In other words, we extend the traditional Duplication-Loss reconciliation problem of a single gene tree, to a set of trees, accounting for segmental duplications and losses. Existency of a Super-Reconciliation depends on individual gene tree consistency. In addition, ignoring rearrangements implies that existency also depends on gene order consistency. We first show that the problem of reconstructing a most parsimonious Super-Reconciliation, if any, is NP-hard and give an exact exponential-time algorithm to solve it. Alternatively, we show that accounting for rearrangements in the evolutionary model, but still only minimizing segmental duplication and loss events, leads to an exact polynomial-time algorithm. We finally assess time efficiency of the former exponential time algorithm for the Duplication-Loss model on simulated datasets, and give a proof of concept on the opioid receptor genes.\n",

We propose a novel and efficient algorithm, called DAMOKLE, to identify differentially mutated subnetworks given genome-wide mutation data for two sets of cancer samples. We prove that DAMOKLE identifies subnetworks with statistically significant difference in mutation frequency when the data comes from a reasonable generative model, provided enough samples are available. We test DAMOKLE on simulated and real data, showing that DAMOKLE does indeed find subnetworks with significant differences in mutation frequency and that it provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease not revealed by standard methods.\n",

            "Boolean models of biological signalling-regulatory networks are increasingly used to formally describe and understand complex biological processes. These models may become inconsistent as new data become available and need to be repaired. In the past, the focus has been shed on the inference of (classes of) models given an interaction network and time-series data sets. However, repair of existing models against new data is still in its infancy, where the process is still manually performed and therefore slow and prone to errors. In this work, we propose a method with an associated tool to suggest repairs over inconsistent Boolean models, based on a set of atomic repair operations. Answer Set Programming is used to encode the minimal repair problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. In particular, given an inconsistent model, the tool provides the minimal repairs that render the model capable of generating dynamics coherent with a (set of) time-series data set(s), considering either a synchronous or an asynchronous updating scheme. The method was validated using known biological models from different species, as well as synthetic models obtained from randomly generated networks. We discuss the method’s limitations regarding each of the updating schemes and the considered minimization algorithm.\n",

            "With long reads getting even longer and cheaper, large scale sequencing projects can be accomplished without short reads at an affordable cost. Due to the high error rates and less mature tools, de novo assembly of long reads is still challenging and often results in a large collection of contigs. Dense linkage maps are collections of markers whose location on the genome is approximately known. Therefore they provide long range information that has the potential to greatly aid in de novo assembly. Previously linkage maps have been used to detect misassemblies and to manually order contigs. However, no fully automated tools exist to incorporate linkage maps in assembly but instead large amounts of manual labour is needed to order the contigs into chromosomes. We formulate the genome assembly problem in the presence of linkage maps and present the first method for guided genome assembly using linkage maps. Our method is based on an additional cleaning step added to the assembly. We show that it can simplify the underlying assembly graph, resulting in more contiguous assemblies and reducing the amount of misassemblies when compared to de novo assembly. We present the first method to integrate linkage maps directly into genome assembly. With a modest increase in runtime, our method improves contiguity and correctness of genome assembly.\n",

However, it is well-known that the evolution of gene families is interconnected. In this paper, we extend a previous approach to reconcile a set of gene trees with a species tree based on segmental macro-evolutionary events, where segmental duplication events and losses are associated with cost δ and λ, respectively. We show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when δ≤λ (via LCA-mapping), while if δ>λ the problem is NP-hard, even when λ=0 and a single gene tree is given, solving a long standing open problem on the complexity of multi-gene reconciliation. On the positive side, we give a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem, where the parameters are δ/λ and the number d of segmental duplications, of time complexity O(⌈δλ⌉d⋅n⋅δλ). Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm on two previously studied real datasets: we first show that our method can be used to confirm or raise doubt on hypothetical segmental duplications on a set of 16 eukaryotes, then show how we can detect whole genome duplications in yeast genomes.\n",

            "Network connectivity problems are abundant in computational biology research, where graphs are used to represent a range of phenomena: from physical interactions between molecules to more abstract relationships such as gene co-expression. One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner Network problems: given a reference “database” graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands. While this formulation proved useful in a number of instances, the next challenge is to account for the fact that the reference graph may not be static. This can happen for instance, when studying protein measurements in single cells or at different time points, whereby different subsets of conditions can have different protein milieu. We introduce the condition Steiner Network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition. We show that introducing multiple conditions as an additional factor makes this problem much harder to approximate. Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C−ϵ, for every C≥2 and ϵ>0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver. Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.\n",

            "Sequencing technologies keep on turning cheaper and faster, thus putting a growing pressure for data structures designed to efficiently store raw data, and possibly perform analysis therein. In this view, there is a growing interest in alignment-free and reference-free variants calling methods that only make use of (suitably indexed) raw reads data. We develop the positional clustering theory that (i) describes how the extended Burrows–Wheeler Transform (eBWT) of a collection of reads tends to cluster together bases that cover the same genome position (ii) predicts the size of such clusters, and (iii) exhibits an elegant and precise LCP array based procedure to locate such clusters in the eBWT. Based on this theory, we designed and implemented an alignment-free and reference-free SNPs calling method, and we devised a consequent SNPs calling pipeline. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that SNPs can be detected with a simple scan of the eBWT and LCP arrays as, in accordance with our theoretical framework, they are within clusters in the eBWT of the reads. Finally, our tool intrinsically performs a reference-free evaluation of its accuracy by returning the coverage of each SNP. Based on the results of the experiments on synthetic and real data, we conclude that the positional clustering framework can be effectively used for the problem of identifying SNPs, and it appears to be a promising approach for calling other type of variants directly on raw sequencing data. \n",

            "Absolute fast converging (AFC) phylogeny estimation methods are ones that have been proven to recover the true tree with high probability given sequences whose lengths are polynomial in the number of number of leaves in the tree (once the shortest and longest branch weights are fixed). While there has been a large literature on AFC methods, the best in terms of empirical performance was DCMNJ, published in SODA 2001. The main empirical advantage of DCMNJ over other AFC methods is its use of neighbor joining (NJ) to construct trees on smaller taxon subsets, which are then combined into a tree on the full set of species using a supertree method; in contrast, the other AFC methods in essence depend on quartet trees that are computed independently of each other, which reduces accuracy compared to neighbor joining. However, DCMNJ is unlikely to scale to large datasets due to its reliance on supertree methods, as no current supertree methods are able to scale to large datasets with high accuracy. In this study we present a new approach to large-scale phylogeny estimation that shares some of the features of DCMNJ but bypasses the use of supertree methods. We prove that this new approach is AFC and uses polynomial time and space. Furthermore, we describe variations on this basic approach that can be used with leaf-disjoint constraint trees (computed using methods such as maximum likelihood) to produce other methods that are likely to provide even better accuracy. Thus, we present a new generalizable technique for large-scale tree estimation that is designed to improve scalability for phylogeny estimation methods to ultra-large datasets, and that can be used in a variety of settings (including tree estimation from unaligned sequences, and species tree estimation from gene trees).\n",

We formally introduce the molecular charge assignment problem, where the task is to select a charge from a set of candidate charges for every atom of a given query molecule. Charges are accompanied by a score that depends on their observed frequency in similar neighbourhoods (chemical environments) in a database of previously parameterised molecules. The aim is to assign the charges such that the total charge equals a known target charge within a margin of error while maximizing the sum of the charge scores. We show that the problem is a variant of the well-studied multiple-choice knapsack problem and thus weakly NP-complete. We propose solutions based on Integer Linear Programming and a pseudo-polynomial time Dynamic Programming algorithm. We demonstrate that the results obtained for novel molecules not included in the database are comparable to the ones obtained performing explicit charge calculations while decreasing the time to determine partial charges for a molecule from hours or even days to below a second.

They typically generate sequence lists ranked by an experimentally acquired functional property such as gene expression or protein binding affinity. Current motif discovery tools suffer from limitations in searching large motif spaces, and thus more complex motifs may not be included. There is thus a need for motif analysis methods that are tailored for analyzing specific complex motifs motivated by biological questions and hypotheses rather than acting as a screen based motif finding tool. We present Regmex (REGular expression Motif EXplorer), which offers several methods to identify overrepresented motifs in ranked lists of sequences. Regmex uses regular expressions to define motifs or families of motifs and embedded Markov models to calculate exact p-values for motif observations in sequences. Biases in motif distributions across ranked sequence lists are evaluated using random walks, Brownian bridges, or modified rank based statistics. A modular setup and fast analytic p value evaluations make Regmex applicable to diverse and potentially large-scale motif analysis problems. We demonstrate use cases of combined motifs on simulated data and on expression data from micro RNA transfection experiments. We confirm previously obtained results and demonstrate the usability of Regmex to test a specific hypothesis about the relative location of microRNA seed sites and U-rich motifs. We further compare the tool with an existing motif discovery tool and show increased sensitivity. Regmex is a useful and flexible tool to analyze motif hypotheses that relates to large data sets in functional genomics.

Their practical importance derives from the fact they are connected to their host graph by a single entrance and a single exit vertex, thus allowing them to be handled independently. Efficient algorithms for the enumeration of superbubbles are therefore of important for the processing of HTS data. Superbubbles can be identified within the strongly connected components of the input digraph after transforming them into directed acyclic graphs. The algorithm by Sung et al. (IEEE ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform 12:770–777, 2015) achieves this task in O(m log(m))-time. The extraction of superbubbles from the transformed components was later improved to by Brankovic et al. (Theor Comput Sci 609:374–383, 2016) resulting in an overall O(m+n)-time algorithm. A re-analysis of the mathematical structure of superbubbles showed that the construction of auxiliary DAGs from the strongly connected components in the work of Sung et al. missed some details that can lead to the reporting of false positive superbubbles. We propose an alternative, even simpler auxiliary graph that solved the problem and retains the linear running time for general digraph. Furthermore, we describe a simpler, space-efficient O(m+n)-time algorithm for detecting superbubbles in DAGs that uses only simple data structures. We present a reference implementation of the algorithm that accepts many commonly used formats for the input graph and provides convenient access to the improved algorithm. https://github.com/Fabianexe/Superbubble.\n",

Because subtle features are central for explaining how proteins achieve specificity, algorithmic efficiency and geometric precision are central to algorithmic design. To address these concerns, this paper presents pClay, the first algorithm to perform parallel and arbitrarily precise comparisons of molecular surfaces and electrostatic isopotentials as geometric solids. pClay was presented at the 2019 Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI 2019) and is described in expanded detail here, especially with regard to the comparison of electrostatic isopotentials. Earlier methods have generally used parallelism to enhance computational throughput, pClay is the first algorithm to use parallelism to make arbitrarily high precision comparisons practical. It is also the first method to demonstrate that high precision comparisons of geometric solids can yield more precise structural inferences than algorithms that use existing standards of precision. One advantage of added precision is that statistical models can be trained with more accurate data. Using structural data from an existing method, a model of steric variations between binding cavities can overlook 53% of authentic steric influences on specificity, whereas a model trained with data from pClay overlooks none. Our results also demonstrate the parallel performance of pClay on both workstation CPUs and a 61-core Xeon Phi. While slower on one core, additional processor cores rapidly outpaced single core performance and existing methods. Based on these results, it is clear that pClay has applications in the automatic explanation of binding mechanisms and in the rational design of protein binding preferences.\n",

As a consequence the demand for methods supporting comparative, evolutionary analysis is also growing. In particular, efficient tools to visualize-omics data simultaneously for multiple species are sorely lacking. A first and crucial step in this direction is the construction of a common coordinate system. Since genomes not only differ by rearrangements but also by large insertions, deletions, and duplications, the use of a single reference genome is insufficient, in particular when the number of species becomes large. The computational problem then becomes to determine an order and orientations of optimal local alignments that are as co-linear as possible with all the genome sequences. We first review the most prominent approaches to model the problem formally and then proceed to showing that it can be phrased as a particular variant of the BETWEENNESS PROBLEM. It is NP hard in general. As exact solutions are beyond reach for the problem sizes of practical interest, we introduce a collection of heuristic simplifiers to resolve ordering conflicts.

De novo peptide sequencing is the problem of reconstructing the amino acid sequences of a peptide from this measurement data. Past de novo sequencing algorithms solely consider the mass spectrum of the fragments for reconstructing a sequence. We propose to additionally exploit the information obtained from liquid chromatography. We study the problem of computing a sequence that is not only in accordance with the experimental mass spectrum, but also with the chromatographic retention time. We consider three models for predicting the retention time and develop algorithms for de novo sequencing for each model. Based on an evaluation for two prediction models on experimental data from synthesized peptides we conclude that the identification rates are improved by exploiting the chromatographic information. In our evaluation, we compare our algorithms using the retention time information with algorithms using the same scoring model, but not the retention time.\n",

            "One way to estimate the evolutionary distance between two given genomes is to determine the minimum number of large-scale mutations, or genome rearrangements, that are necessary to transform one into the other. In this context, genomes can be represented as ordered sequences of genes, each gene being represented by a signed integer. If no gene is repeated, genomes are thus modeled as signed permutations of the form \\pi =(\\pi _1 \\pi _2 \\ldots \\pi _n), and in that case we can consider without loss of generality that one of them is the identity permutation \\iota _n =(1 2 \\ldots n), and that we just need to sort the other (i.e., transform it into \\iota _n). The most studied genome rearrangement events are reversals, where a segment of the genome is reversed and reincorporated at the same location; and transpositions, where two consecutive segments are exchanged. Many variants, e.g., combining different types of (possibly constrained) rearrangements, have been proposed in the literature. One of them considers that the number of genes involved, in a reversal or a transposition, is never greater than two, which is known as the problem of sorting by super short operations (or SSOs). All problems considering SSOs in permutations have been shown to be in P, except for one, namely sorting signed circular permutations by super short reversals and super short transpositions. Here we fill this gap by introducing a new graph structure called cyclic permutation graph and providing a series of intermediate results, which allows us to design a polynomial algorithm for sorting signed circular permutations by super short reversals and super short transpositions.\n",

In recent years, genomes having more than two sets of homologous chromosomes have attracted many research groups that are interested in the genomics of disease, phylogenetics, botany and evolution. However, there is still a lack of methods for reconstructing polyploid haplotypes. In this work, the minimum error correction with genotype information (MEC/GI) model, an important combinatorial model for haplotyping a single individual, is used to study the triploid individual haplotype reconstruction problem. A fast and accurate enumeration-based algorithm enumeration haplotyping triploid with least difference (EHTLD) is proposed for solving the MEC/GI model. The EHTLD algorithm tries to reconstruct the three haplotypes according to the order of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci along them. When reconstructing a given SNP site, the EHTLD algorithm enumerates three kinds of SNP values in terms of the corresponding site’s genotype value, and chooses the one, which leads to the minimum difference between the reconstructed haplotypes and the sequenced fragments covering that SNP site, to fill the SNP loci being reconstructed. Extensive experimental comparisons were performed between the EHTLD algorithm and the well known HapCompass and HapTree. Compared with algorithms HapCompass and HapTree, the EHTLD algorithm can reconstruct more accurate haplotypes, which were proven by a number of experiments.\n",

            "The double cut and join (DCJ) model of genome rearrangement is well studied due to its mathematical simplicity and power to account for the many events that transform gene order. These studies have mostly been devoted to the understanding of minimum length scenarios transforming one genome into another. In this paper we search instead for rearrangement scenarios that minimize the number of rearrangements whose breakpoints are unlikely due to some biological criteria. One such criterion has recently become accessible due to the advent of the Hi-C experiment, facilitating the study of 3D spacial distance between breakpoint regions. We establish a link between the minimum number of unlikely rearrangements required by a scenario and the problem of finding a maximum edge-disjoint cycle packing on a certain transformed version of the adjacency graph. This link leads to a 3/2-approximation as well as an exact integer linear programming formulation for our problem, which we prove to be NP-complete. We also present experimental results on fruit flies, showing that Hi-C data is informative when used as a criterion for rearrangements. A new variant of the weighted DCJ distance problem is addressed that ignores scenario length in its objective function. A solution to this problem provides a lower bound on the number of unlikely moves necessary when transforming one gene order into another. This lower bound aids in the study of rearrangement scenarios with respect to chromatin structure, and could eventually be used in the design of a fixed parameter algorithm with a more general objective function.\n",

            "\n",
            "Patterns with wildcards in specified positions, namely spaced seeds, are increasingly used instead of k-mers in many bioinformatics applications that require indexing, querying and rapid similarity search, as they can provide better sensitivity. Many of these applications require to compute the hashing of each position in the input sequences with respect to the given spaced seed, or to multiple spaced seeds. While the hashing of k-mers can be rapidly computed by exploiting the large overlap between consecutive k-mers, spaced seeds hashing is usually computed from scratch for each position in the input sequence, thus resulting in slower processing. The method proposed in this paper, fast spaced-seed hashing (FSH), exploits the similarity of the hash values of spaced seeds computed at adjacent positions in the input sequence. In our experiments we compute the hash for each positions of metagenomics reads from several datasets, with respect to different spaced seeds. We also propose a generalized version of the algorithm for the simultaneous computation of multiple spaced seeds hashing. In the experiments, our algorithm can compute the hashing values of spaced seeds with a speedup, with respect to the traditional approach, between 1.6× to 5.3×, depending on the structure of the spaced seed. Spaced seed hashing is a routine task for several bioinformatics application. FSH allows to perform this task efficiently and raise the question of whether other hashing can be exploited to further improve the speed up. This has the potential of major impact in the field, making spaced seed applications not only accurate, but also faster and more efficient.\n",

            "\n",
            "An important task in a metagenomic analysis is the assignment of taxonomic labels to sequences in a sample. Most widely used methods for taxonomy assignment compare a sequence in the sample to a database of known sequences. Many approaches use the best BLAST hit(s) to assign the taxonomic label. However, it is known that the best BLAST hit may not always correspond to the best taxonomic match. An alternative approach involves phylogenetic methods, which take into account alignments and a model of evolution in order to more accurately define the taxonomic origin of sequences. Similarity-search based methods typically run faster than phylogenetic methods and work well when the organisms in the sample are well represented in the database. In contrast, phylogenetic methods have the capability to identify new organisms in a sample but are computationally quite expensive. We propose a two-step approach for metagenomic taxon identification; i.e., use a rapid method that accurately classifies sequences using a reference database (this is a filtering step) and then use a more complex phylogenetic method for the sequences that were unclassified in the previous step. In this work, we explore whether and when using top BLAST hit(s) yields a correct taxonomic label. We develop a method to detect outliers among BLAST hits in order to separate the phylogenetically most closely related matches from matches to sequences from more distantly related organisms. We used modified BILD (Bayesian Integral Log-Odds) scores, a multiple-alignment scoring function, to define the outliers within a subset of top BLAST hits and assign taxonomic labels. We compared the accuracy of our method to the RDP classifier and show that our method yields fewer misclassifications while properly classifying organisms that are not present in the database. Finally, we evaluated the use of our method as a pre-processing step before more expensive phylogenetic analyses (in our case TIPP) in the context of real 16S rRNA datasets. Our experiments make a good case for using a two-step approach for accurate taxonomic assignment. We show that our method can be used as a filtering step before using phylogenetic methods and provides a way to interpret BLAST results using more information than provided by E-values and bit-scores alone.\n",

            "\n",
            "For a combination of reasons (including data generation protocols, approaches to taxon and gene sampling, and gene birth and loss), estimated gene trees are often incomplete, meaning that they do not contain all of the species of interest. As incomplete gene trees can impact downstream analyses, accurate completion of gene trees is desirable. We introduce the Optimal Tree Completion problem, a general optimization problem that involves completing an unrooted binary tree (i.e., adding missing leaves) so as to minimize its distance from a reference tree on a superset of the leaves. We present OCTAL, an algorithm that finds an optimal solution to this problem when the distance between trees is defined using the Robinson–Foulds (RF) distance, and we prove that OCTAL runs in O(n2) time, where n is the total number of species. We report on a simulation study in which gene trees can differ from the species tree due to incomplete lineage sorting, and estimated gene trees are completed using OCTAL with a reference tree based on a species tree estimated from the multi-locus dataset. OCTAL produces completed gene trees that are closer to the true gene trees than an existing heuristic approach in ASTRAL-II, but the accuracy of a completed gene tree computed by OCTAL depends on how topologically similar the reference tree (typically an estimated species tree) is to the true gene tree. OCTAL is a useful technique for adding missing taxa to incomplete gene trees and provides good accuracy under a wide range of model conditions. However, results show that OCTAL’s accuracy can be reduced when incomplete lineage sorting is high, as the reference tree can be far from the true gene tree. Hence, this study suggests that OCTAL would benefit from using other types of reference trees instead of species trees when there are large topological distances between true gene trees and species trees.\n",

            "\n",
            "In the field of genome rearrangement algorithms, models accounting for gene duplication lead often to hard problems. For example, while computing the pairwise distance is tractable in most duplication-free models, the problem is NP-complete for most extensions of these models accounting for duplicated genes. Moreover, problems involving more than two genomes, such as the genome median and the Small Parsimony problem, are intractable for most duplication-free models, with some exceptions, for example the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) model. We introduce a variant of the SCJ distance that accounts for duplicated genes, in the context of directed evolution from an ancestral genome to a descendant genome where orthology relations between ancestral genes and their descendant are known. Our model includes two duplication mechanisms: single-gene tandem duplication and the creation of single-gene circular chromosomes. We prove that in this model, computing the directed distance and a parsimonious evolutionary scenario in terms of SCJ and single-gene duplication events can be done in linear time. We also show that the directed median problem is tractable for this distance, while the rooted median problem, where we assume that one of the given genomes is ancestral to the median, is NP-complete. We also describe an Integer Linear Program for solving this problem. We evaluate the directed distance and rooted median algorithms on simulated data. Our results provide a simple genome rearrangement model, extending the SCJ model to account for single-gene duplications, for which we prove a mix of tractability and hardness results. For the NP-complete rooted median problem, we design a simple Integer Linear Program. Our publicly available implementation of these algorithms for the directed distance and median problems allow to solve efficiently these problems on large instances.\n",

            "A profile-comparison method with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is among the most accurate alignment methods. Currently, cosine similarity and correlation coefficients are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear whether these functions are optimal for profile alignment methods. By definition, these functions cannot capture nonlinear relationships between profiles. Therefore, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was more suitable for the profile-comparison method than existing functions, using neural networks. Although neural networks required derivative-of-cost functions, the problem being addressed in this study lacked them. Therefore, we implemented a novel derivative-free neural network by combining a conventional neural network with an evolutionary strategy optimization method used as a solver. Using this novel neural network system, we optimized the scoring function to align remote sequence pairs. Our results showed that the pairwise-profile aligner using the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision relative to aligners using existing functions. We developed and implemented a novel derivative-free neural network and aligner (Nepal) for optimizing sequence alignments. Nepal improved alignment quality by adapting to remote sequence alignments and increasing the expressiveness of similarity scores. Additionally, this novel scoring function can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into other aligners. Moreover our scoring function could potentially improve the performance of homology detection and/or multiple-sequence alignment of remote homologous sequences. The goal of the study was to provide a novel scoring function for profile alignment method and develop a novel learning system capable of addressing derivative-free problems. Our system is capable of optimizing the performance of other sophisticated methods and solving problems without derivative-of-cost functions, which do not always exist in practical problems. Our results demonstrated the usefulness of this optimization method for derivative-free problems.\n",

Sequence-based typing methods are a gold standard for epidemiological surveillance due to the inherent portability of sequence and allelic profile data, fast analysis times and their capacity to create common nomenclatures for strains or clones. This led to development of several novel methods and several databases being made available for many microbial species. With the mainstream use of High Throughput Sequencing, the amount of data being accumulated in these databases is huge, storing thousands of different profiles. On the other hand, computing genetic evolutionary distances among a set of typing profiles or taxa dominates the running time of many phylogenetic inference methods. It is important also to note that most of genetic evolution distance definitions rely, even if indirectly, on computing the pairwise Hamming distance among sequences or profiles. We propose here an average-case linear-time algorithm to compute pairwise Hamming distances among a set of taxa under a given Hamming distance threshold. This article includes both a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results concerning the proposed algorithm. We further show how this algorithm can be successfully integrated into a well known phylogenetic inference method, and how it can be used to speedup querying local phylogenetic patterns over large typing databases.\n",

            "Reconstructing the genome of a species from short fragments is one of the oldest bioinformatics problems. Metagenomic assembly is a variant of the problem asking to reconstruct the circular genomes of all bacterial species present in a sequencing sample. This problem can be naturally formulated as finding a collection of circular walks of a directed graph G that together cover all nodes, or edges, of G. We address this problem with the “safe and complete” framework of Tomescu and Medvedev (Research in computational Molecular biology—20th annual conference, RECOMB 9649:152–163, 2016). An algorithm is called safe if it returns only those walks (also called safe) that appear as subwalk in all metagenomic assembly solutions for G. A safe algorithm is called complete if it returns all safe walks of G. We give graph-theoretic characterizations of the safe walks of G, and a safe and complete algorithm finding all safe walks of G. In the node-covering case, our algorithm runs in time O(m2+n3), and in the edge-covering case it runs in time O(m2n); n and m denote the number of nodes and edges, respectively, of G. This algorithm constitutes the first theoretical tight upper bound on what can be safely assembled from metagenomic reads using this problem formulation.\n",

            "In the absence of horizontal gene transfer it is possible to reconstruct the history of gene families from empirically determined orthology relations, which are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees. Knowledge of the event labels considerably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species trees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the event types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled case may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here we investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation problem with horizontal transfer. We investigate the issue of time-consistency for the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a convenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of time-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak conditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which evolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an O(|V(T)|log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent reconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit timing maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking whether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic. The algorithms are implemented in C++ using the boost graph library and are freely available at https://github.com/Nojgaard/tc-recon. The combinatorial characterization of time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an important step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal transfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees. The fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context because it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree reconciliation problems.\n",

In its standard formulation, the objective is to find a species tree that minimizes the total number of gene duplications and losses with respect to the input set of gene trees. Although much is known about GTP, little is known about how to treat inputs containing some incomplete gene trees (i.e., gene trees lacking one or more of the species). We present new theory for GTP considering whether the incompleteness is due to gene birth and death (i.e., true biological loss) or taxon sampling, and present dynamic programming algorithms that can be used for an exact but exponential time solution for small numbers of taxa, or as a heuristic for larger numbers of taxa. We also prove that the “standard” calculations for duplications and losses exactly solve GTP when incompleteness results from taxon sampling, although they can be incorrect when incompleteness results from true biological loss.

The external memory construction of the generalized suffix array for a string collection is a fundamental task when the size of the input collection or the data structure exceeds the available internal memory. In this article we present and analyze eGSA [introduced in CPM (External memory generalized suffix and LCP arrays construction. In: Proceedings of CPM. pp 201–10, 2013)], the first external memory algorithm to construct generalized suffix arrays augmented with the longest common prefix array for a string collection. Our algorithm relies on a combination of buffers, induced sorting and a heap to avoid direct string comparisons. We performed experiments that covered different aspects of our algorithm, including running time, efficiency, external memory access, internal phases and the influence of different optimization strategies. On real datasets of size up to 24 GB and using 2 GB of internal memory, eGSA showed a competitive performance when compared to eSAIS and SAscan, which are efficient algorithms for a single string according to the related literature. We also show the effect of disk caching managed by the operating system on our algorithm. The proposed algorithm was validated through performance tests using real datasets from different domains, in various combinations, and showed a competitive performance.

            "In order to find correlated pairs of positions between proteins, which are useful in predicting interactions, it is necessary to concatenate two large multiple sequence alignments such that the sequences that are joined together belong to those that interact in their species of origin. When each protein is unique then the species name is sufficient to guide this match, however, when there are multiple related sequences (paralogs) in each species then the pairing is more difficult. In bacteria a good guide can be gained from genome co-location as interacting proteins tend to be in a common operon but in eukaryotes this simple principle is not sufficient. The methods developed in this paper take sets of paralogs for different proteins found in the same species and make a pairing based on their evolutionary distance relative to a set of other proteins that are unique and so have a known relationship (singletons). The former constitute a set of unlabelled nodes in a graph while the latter are labelled. Two variants were tested, one based on a phylogenetic tree of the sequences (the topology-based method) and a simpler, faster variant based only on the inter-sequence distances (the distance-based method). Over a set of test proteins, both gave good results, with the topology method performing slightly better. The methods develop here still need refinement and augmentation from constraints other than the sequence data alone, such as known interactions from annotation and databases, or non-trivial relationships in genome location. With the ever growing numbers of eukaryotic genomes, it is hoped that the methods described here will open a route to the use of these data equal to the current success attained with bacterial sequences.\n",

            "The history of gene families—which are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees—can be reconstructed from empirically estimated evolutionary event-relations containing pairs of orthologous, paralogous or xenologous genes. The question then arises as whether inferred event-labeled gene trees are biologically feasible, that is, if there is a possible true history that would explain a given gene tree. In practice, this problem is boiled down to finding a reconciliation map—also known as DTL-scenario—between the event-labeled gene trees and a (possibly unknown) species tree. In this contribution, we first characterize whether there is a valid reconciliation map for binary event-labeled gene trees T that contain speciation, duplication and horizontal gene transfer events and some unknown species tree S in terms of “informative” triples that are displayed in T and provide information of the topology of S. These informative triples are used to infer the unknown species tree S for T. We obtain a similar result for non-binary gene trees. To this end, however, the reconciliation map needs to be further restricted. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there is a species tree for a given event-labeled gene tree, and in the positive case, to construct the species tree and the respective (restricted) reconciliation map. However, informative triples as well as DTL-scenarios have their limitations when they are used to explain the biological feasibility of gene trees. While reconciliation maps imply biological feasibility, we show that the converse is not true in general. Moreover, we show that informative triples neither provide enough information to characterize “relaxed” DTL-scenarios nor non-restricted reconciliation maps for non-binary biologically feasible gene trees.\n",

In mitochondrial genomes different mechanisms are likely at work, at least some of which involve the duplication of sequence around the location of the apparent breakpoints. We hypothesize that these different mechanisms of genome rearrangement leave distinctive sequence footprints. In order to study such effects it is important to locate the breakpoint positions with precision. We define a partially local sequence alignment problem that assumes that following a rearrangement of a sequence F, two fragments L, and R are produced that may exactly fit together to match F, leave a gap of deleted DNA between L and R, or overlap with each other. We show that this alignment problem can be solved by dynamic programming in cubic space and time. We apply the new method to evaluate rearrangements of animal mitogenomes and find that a surprisingly large fraction of these events involved local sequence duplications. The partially local sequence alignment method is an effective way to investigate the mechanism of genomic rearrangement events. While applied here only to mitogenomes there is no reason why the method could not be used to also consider rearrangements in nuclear genomes.\n",

Among the most widely used methods in this class is the standard bootstrap method, which consists of random sampling with replacement. While not requiring assumptions about any particular parametric model for resampling purposes, the bootstrap and related techniques assume that sites are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The i.i.d. assumption can be an over-simplification for many problems in computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular, sequential dependence within biomolecular sequences is often an essential biological feature due to biochemical function, evolutionary processes such as recombination, and other factors. To relax the simplifying i.i.d. assumption, we propose a new non-parametric/semi-parametric sequential resampling technique that generalizes “Heads-or-Tails” mirrored inputs, a simple but clever technique due to Landan and Graur. The generalized procedure takes the form of random walks along either aligned or unaligned biomolecular sequences. We refer to our new method as the SERES (or “SEquential RESampling”) method. To demonstrate the performance of the new technique, we apply SERES to estimate support for the multiple sequence alignment problem. Using simulated and empirical data, we show that SERES-based support estimation yields comparable or typically better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n",

Our algorithm combines latent variables with the method of moments instead of maximum likelihood, which has computational advantages over the popular EM algorithm. As an application, we demonstrate that methylation state classification is more accurate when using adaptive thresholds from beta mixtures than non-adaptive thresholds on observed methylation levels. We also demonstrate that we can accurately infer the number of mixture components. The hybrid algorithm between likelihood-based component un-mixing and moment-based parameter estimation is a robust and efficient method for beta mixture estimation.

The second problem arises when the two trees to be compared have only partially overlapping leaf sets. The traditional approach to handling these problems is to first restrict the two trees to their common leaf set. An alternative approach that has shown promise is to first complete the trees by adding missing leaves, so that the resulting trees have identical leaf sets. This requires the computation of an optimal completion that minimizes the distance between the two resulting trees over all possible completions.\n",

This approximation of best matches by best hits becomes exact for ultrametric dissimilarities, i.e., under the Molecular Clock Hypothesis. It fails, however, whenever there are large lineage specific rate variations among paralogous genes. In practice, this introduces a high level of noise into the input data for best-hit-based orthology detection methods. If additive distances between genes are known, then evolutionary most closely related pairs can be identified by considering certain quartets of genes provided that in each quartet the outgroup relative to the remaining three genes is known. A priori knowledge of underlying species phylogeny greatly facilitates the identification of the required outgroup. Although the workflow remains a heuristic since the correct outgroup cannot be determined reliably in all cases, simulations with lineage specific biases and rate asymmetries show that nearly perfect results can be achieved. In a realistic setting, where distances data have to be estimated from sequence data and hence are noisy, it is still possible to obtain highly accurate sets of best matches.\n",

We present a new whole-genome based approach to infer phylogenies that is alignment- and reference-free. In contrast to other methods, it does not rely on pairwise comparisons to determine distances to infer edges in a tree. Instead, a colored de Bruijn graph is constructed, and information on common subsequences is extracted to infer phylogenetic splits. The introduced new methodology for large-scale phylogenomics shows high potential. Application to different datasets confirms robustness of the approach.

As a result, in this research we use clustering-based space that convert the geometric space of the molecular to a categorical space based on clustering results. Then we use this space for developing a new classification algorithm. In this study, we propose a new classification method named GrpClassifierEC that replaces the given data space with categorical space based on ensemble clustering (EC). The EC space is defined by tracking the membership of the points over multiple runs of clustering algorithms. Different points that were included in the same clusters will be represented as a single point. Our algorithm classifies all these points as a single class. The similarity between two objects is defined as the number of times that these objects were not belong to the same cluster. In order to evaluate our suggested method, we compare its results to the k nearest neighbors, Decision tree and Random forest classification algorithms on several benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the suggested new algorithm GrpClassifierEC outperforms the other algorithms. Our algorithm can be integrated with many other algorithms. In this research, we use only the k-means clustering algorithm with different k values. In future research, we propose several directions: (1) checking the effect of the clustering algorithm to build an ensemble clustering space.

However, it is now generally accepted that genes and environment must be examined jointly when estimating phenotypic variance. In this work we consider two types of biological markers: genotypic markers, which characterize an observation in terms of inherited genetic information, and metagenomic marker which are related to the environment. Both types of markers are available in their millions and can be used to characterize any observation uniquely.\\n\\nObjective\\nOur focus is on detecting interactions between groups of genetic and metagenomic markers in order to gain a better understanding of the complex relationship between environment and genome in the expression of a given phenotype.\\n\\nContributions\\nWe propose a novel approach for efficiently detecting interactions between complementary datasets in a high-dimensional setting with a reduced computational cost. The method, named SICOMORE, reduces the dimension of the search space by selecting a subset of supervariables in the two complementary datasets. These supervariables are given by a weighted group structure defined on sets of variables at different scales. A Lasso selection is then applied on each type of supervariable to obtain a subset of potential interactions that will be explored via linear model testing.\\n\\nResults\\nWe compare SICOMORE with other approaches in simulations, with varying sample sizes, noise, and numbers of true interactions. SICOMORE exhibits convincing results in terms of recall, as well as competitive performances with respect to running time. The method is also used to detect interaction between genomic markers in Medicago truncatula and metagenomic markers in its rhizosphere bacterial community.\\n\\nSoftware availability\\nAn R package is available [4], along with its documentation and associated scripts, allowing the reader to reproduce the results presented in the paper.',\n",
              " 'Non-parametric correction of estimated gene trees using TRACTION\\n\\nEstimated gene trees are often inaccurate, due to insufficient phylogenetic signal in the single gene alignment, among other causes. Gene tree correction aims to improve the accuracy of an estimated gene tree by using computational techniques along with auxiliary information, such as a reference species tree or sequencing data. However, gene trees and species trees can differ as a result of gene duplication and loss (GDL), incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), and other biological processes. Thus gene tree correction methods need to take estimation error as well as gene tree heterogeneity into account. Many prior gene tree correction methods have been developed for the case where GDL is present. Here, we study the problem of gene tree correction where gene tree heterogeneity is instead due to ILS and/or HGT. We introduce TRACTION, a simple polynomial time method that provably finds an optimal solution to the RF-optimal tree refinement and completion (RF-OTRC) Problem, which seeks a refinement and completion of a singly-labeled gene tree with respect to a given singly-labeled species tree so as to minimize the Robinson−Foulds (RF) distance. Our extensive simulation study on 68,000 estimated gene trees shows that TRACTION matches or improves on the accuracy of well-established methods from the GDL literature when HGT and ILS are both present, and ties for best under the ILS-only conditions. Furthermore, TRACTION ties for fastest on these datasets. We also show that a naive generalization of the RF-OTRC problem to multi-labeled trees is possible, but can produce misleading results where gene tree heterogeneity is due to GDL. ',\n",
              " 'KOHDISTA: an efficient method to index and query possible Rmap alignments\\n\\nGenome-wide optical maps are ordered high-resolution restriction maps that give the position of occurrence of restriction cut sites corresponding to one or more restriction enzymes. These genome-wide optical maps are assembled using an overlap-layout-consensus approach using raw optical map data, which are referred to as Rmaps. Due to the high error-rate of Rmap data, finding the overlap between Rmaps remains challenging. We present KOHDISTA, which is an index-based algorithm for finding pairwise alignments between single molecule maps (Rmaps). The novelty of our approach is the formulation of the alignment problem as automaton path matching, and the application of modern index-based data structures. In particular, we combine the use of the Generalized Compressed Suffix Array (GCSA) index with the wavelet tree in order to build KOHDISTA. We validate KOHDISTA on simulated E. coli data, showing the approach successfully finds alignments between Rmaps simulated from overlapping genomic regions. we demonstrate KOHDISTA is the only method that is capable of finding a significant number of high quality pairwise Rmap alignments for large eukaryote organisms in reasonable time.',\n",
              " 'Adjacency-constrained hierarchical clustering of a band similarity matrix with application to genomics\\n\\nGenomic data analyses such as Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS) or Hi-C studies are often faced with the problem of partitioning chromosomes into successive regions based on a similarity matrix of high-resolution, locus-level measurements. An intuitive way of doing this is to perform a modified Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering (HAC), where only adjacent clusters (according to the ordering of positions within a chromosome) are allowed to be merged. But a major practical drawback of this method is its quadratic time and space complexity in the number of loci, which is typically of the order of 104 to 105 for each chromosome. By assuming that the similarity between physically distant objects is negligible, we are able to propose an implementation of adjacency-constrained HAC with quasi-linear complexity. This is achieved by pre-calculating specific sums of similarities, and storing candidate fusions in a min-heap. Our illustrations on GWAS and Hi-C datasets demonstrate the relevance of this assumption, and show that this method highlights biologically meaningful signals. Thanks to its small time and memory footprint, the method can be run on a standard laptop in minutes or even seconds. Software and sample data are available as an R package, adjclust, that can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).',\n",
              " 'Super short operations on both gene order and intergenic sizes\\n\\nThe evolutionary distance between two genomes can be estimated by computing a minimum length sequence of operations, called genome rearrangements, that transform one genome into another. Usually, a genome is modeled as an ordered sequence of genes, and most of the studies in the genome rearrangement literature consist in shaping biological scenarios into mathematical models. For instance, allowing different genome rearrangements operations at the same time, adding constraints to these rearrangements (e.g., each rearrangement can affect at most a given number of genes), considering that a rearrangement implies a cost depending on its length rather than a unit cost, etc. Most of the works, however, have overlooked some important features inside genomes, such as the presence of sequences of nucleotides between genes, called intergenic regions.\\nIn this work, we investigate the problem of computing the distance between two genomes, taking into account both gene order and intergenic sizes. The genome rearrangement operations we consider here are constrained types of reversals and transpositions, called super short reversals (SSRs) and super short transpositions (SSTs), which affect up to two (consecutive) genes. We denote by super short operations (SSOs) any SSR or SST. We show 3-approximation algorithms when the orientation of the genes is not considered when we allow SSRs, SSTs, or SSOs, and 5-approximation algorithms when considering the orientation for either SSRs or SSOs. We also show that these algorithms improve their approximation factors when the input permutation has a higher number of inversions, where the approximation factor decreases from 3 to either 2 or 1.5, and from 5 to either 3 or 2.',\n",
              " 'Bayesian localization of CNV candidates in WGS data within minutes\\n\\nFull Bayesian inference for detecting copy number variants (CNV) from whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data is still largely infeasible due to computational demands. A recently introduced approach to perform Forward–Backward Gibbs sampling using dynamic Haar wavelet compression has alleviated issues of convergence and, to some extent, speed. Yet, the problem remains challenging in practice. In this paper, we propose an improved algorithmic framework for this approach. We provide new space-efficient data structures to query sufficient statistics in logarithmic time, based on a linear-time, in-place transform of the data, which also improves on the compression ratio. We also propose a new approach to efficiently store and update marginal state counts obtained from the Gibbs sampler. Using this approach, we discover several CNV candidates in two rat populations divergently selected for tame and aggressive behavior, consistent with earlier results concerning the domestication syndrome as well as experimental observations. Computationally, we observe a 29.5-fold decrease in memory, an average 5.8-fold speedup, as well as a 191-fold decrease in minor page faults. We also observe that metrics varied greatly in the old implementation, but not the new one. We conjecture that this is due to the better compression scheme. The fully Bayesian segmentation of the entire WGS data set required 3.5 min and 1.24 GB of memory, and can hence be performed on a commodity laptop.',\n",
              " 'Implications of non-uniqueness in phylogenetic deconvolution of bulk DNA samples of tumors\\n\\nTumors exhibit extensive intra-tumor heterogeneity, the presence of groups of cellular populations with distinct sets of somatic mutations. This heterogeneity is the result of an evolutionary process, described by a phylogenetic tree. In addition to enabling clinicians to devise patient-specific treatment plans, phylogenetic trees of tumors enable researchers to decipher the mechanisms of tumorigenesis and metastasis. However, the problem of reconstructing a phylogenetic tree T given bulk sequencing data from a tumor is more complicated than the classic phylogeny inference problem. Rather than observing the leaves of T directly, we are given mutation frequencies that are the result of mixtures of the leaves of T. The majority of current tumor phylogeny inference methods employ the perfect phylogeny evolutionary model. The underlying PERFECT PHYLOGENY MIXTURE (PPM) combinatorial problem typically has multiple solutions.\\nWe prove that determining the exact number of solutions to the PPM problem is #P-complete and hard to approximate within a constant factor. Moreover, we show that sampling solutions uniformly at random is hard as well. On the positive side, we provide a polynomial-time computable upper bound on the number of solutions and introduce a simple rejection-sampling based scheme that works well for small instances. Using simulated and real data, we identify factors that contribute to and counteract non-uniqueness of solutions. In addition, we study the sampling performance of current methods, identifying significant biases.\\nAwareness of non-uniqueness of solutions to the PPM problem is key to drawing accurate conclusions in downstream analyses based on tumor phylogenies. This work provides the theoretical foundations for non-uniqueness of solutions in tumor phylogeny inference from bulk DNA samples.',\n",

We derive the mixture of distributions of sequence similarity for duplicate gene pairs generated by repeated episodes of whole gene doubling. This involves integrating sequence divergence and gene pair loss through fractionation, using a branching process and a mutational model. We account not only for the timing of these events in terms of local modes, but also the amplitude and variance of the component distributions. This model is then extended to orthologous gene pairs. We apply the model and inference procedures to the evolution of the Solanaceae, focusing on the genomes of economically important crops. We assess how consistent or variable fractionation rates are from species to species and over time.',\n",

In a clonal tree, each vertex represents a specific tumor clone, and is labeled with one or more mutations in a way that each mutation is assigned to the oldest clone that harbors it. Given two clonal trees, our multi-labeled tree dissimilarity (MLTD) measure is defined as the minimum number of mutation/label deletions, (empty) leaf deletions, and vertex (clonal) expansions, applied in any order, to convert each of the two trees to the maximum common tree. We show that the MLTD measure can be computed efficiently in polynomial time and it captures the similarity between trees of different clonal granularity well.',\n",

Among these, one of the most intractable ones has been that of finding the median of three genomes, a special case of the ancestral reconstruction problem. In this work we re-examine our recently proposed way of measuring genome rearrangement distance, namely, the rank distance between the matrix representations of the corresponding genomes, and show that the median of three genomes can be computed exactly in polynomial time O(nω), where ω≤3, with respect to this distance, when the median is allowed to be an arbitrary orthogonal matrix. We define the five fundamental subspaces depending on three input genomes, and use their properties to show that a particular action on each of these subspaces produces a median. In the process we introduce the notion of M-stable subspaces. We also show that the median found by our algorithm is always orthogonal, symmetric, and conserves any adjacencies or telomeres present in at least 2 out of 3 input genomes. We test our method on both simulated and real data. We find that the majority of the realistic inputs result in genomic outputs, and for those that do not, our two heuristics perform well in terms of reconstructing a genomic matrix attaining a score close to the lower bound, while running in a reasonable amount of time. We conclude that the rank distance is not only theoretically intriguing, but also practically useful for median-finding, and potentially ancestral genome reconstruction.',\n",

We propose a model for weighted DCJ, along with a family of optimization problems called φ-MCPS (MINIMUM COST PARSIMONIOUS SCENARIO), that are based on labeled graphs. We show how to compute solutions to general instances of φ-MCPS, given an algorithm to compute φ-MCPS on a circular genome with exactly one occurrence of each gene. These general instances can have an arbitrary number of circular and linear chromosomes, and arbitrary gene content. The practicality of the framework is displayed by presenting polynomial-time algorithms that generalize the results of Bulteau, Fertin, and Tannier on the SORTING BY WDCJS AND INDELS IN INTERGENES problem, and that generalize previous results on the MINIMUM LOCAL PARSIMONIOUS SCENARIO problem.',\n",
              " 'Evolution through segmental duplications and losses: a Super-Reconciliation approach\\n\\nThe classical gene and species tree reconciliation, used to infer the history of gene gain and loss explaining the evolution of gene families, assumes an independent evolution for each family. While this assumption is reasonable for genes that are far apart in the genome, it is not appropriate for genes grouped into syntenic blocks, which are more plausibly the result of a concerted evolution. Here, we introduce the Super-Reconciliation problem which consists in inferring a history of segmental duplication and loss events (involving a set of neighboring genes) leading to a set of present-day syntenies from a single ancestral one. In other words, we extend the traditional Duplication-Loss reconciliation problem of a single gene tree, to a set of trees, accounting for segmental duplications and losses. Existency of a Super-Reconciliation depends on individual gene tree consistency. In addition, ignoring rearrangements implies that existency also depends on gene order consistency. We first show that the problem of reconstructing a most parsimonious Super-Reconciliation, if any, is NP-hard and give an exact exponential-time algorithm to solve it. Alternatively, we show that accounting for rearrangements in the evolutionary model, but still only minimizing segmental duplication and loss events, leads to an exact polynomial-time algorithm. We finally assess time efficiency of the former exponential time algorithm for the Duplication-Loss model on simulated datasets, and give a proof of concept on the opioid receptor genes.',\n",

We formally define the associated computational problem and show that the problem is NP-hard. We propose a novel and efficient algorithm, called DAMOKLE, to identify differentially mutated subnetworks given genome-wide mutation data for two sets of cancer samples. We prove that DAMOKLE identifies subnetworks with statistically significant difference in mutation frequency when the data comes from a reasonable generative model, provided enough samples are available. We test DAMOKLE on simulated and real data, showing that DAMOKLE does indeed find subnetworks with significant differences in mutation frequency and that it provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of the disease not revealed by standard methods.',\n",
              " 'Repairing Boolean logical models from time-series data using Answer Set Programming\\n\\nBoolean models of biological signalling-regulatory networks are increasingly used to formally describe and understand complex biological processes. These models may become inconsistent as new data become available and need to be repaired. In the past, the focus has been shed on the inference of (classes of) models given an interaction network and time-series data sets. However, repair of existing models against new data is still in its infancy, where the process is still manually performed and therefore slow and prone to errors. In this work, we propose a method with an associated tool to suggest repairs over inconsistent Boolean models, based on a set of atomic repair operations. Answer Set Programming is used to encode the minimal repair problem as a combinatorial optimization problem. In particular, given an inconsistent model, the tool provides the minimal repairs that render the model capable of generating dynamics coherent with a (set of) time-series data set(s), considering either a synchronous or an asynchronous updating scheme. The method was validated using known biological models from different species, as well as synthetic models obtained from randomly generated networks. We discuss the method’s limitations regarding each of the updating schemes and the considered minimization algorithm.',\n",

Due to the high error rates and less mature tools, de novo assembly of long reads is still challenging and often results in a large collection of contigs. Dense linkage maps are collections of markers whose location on the genome is approximately known. Therefore they provide long range information that has the potential to greatly aid in de novo assembly. Previously linkage maps have been used to detect misassemblies and to manually order contigs. However, no fully automated tools exist to incorporate linkage maps in assembly but instead large amounts of manual labour is needed to order the contigs into chromosomes. We formulate the genome assembly problem in the presence of linkage maps and present the first method for guided genome assembly using linkage maps. Our method is based on an additional cleaning step added to the assembly. We show that it can simplify the underlying assembly graph, resulting in more contiguous assemblies and reducing the amount of misassemblies when compared to de novo assembly. We present the first method to integrate linkage maps directly into genome assembly. With a modest increase in runtime, our method improves contiguity and correctness of genome assembly.',\n",
              " 'Reconciling multiple genes trees via segmental duplications and losses\\n\\nReconciling gene trees with a species tree is a fundamental problem to understand the evolution of gene families. Many existing approaches reconcile each gene tree independently. However, it is well-known that the evolution of gene families is interconnected. In this paper, we extend a previous approach to reconcile a set of gene trees with a species tree based on segmental macro-evolutionary events, where segmental duplication events and losses are associated with cost δ and λ, respectively. We show that the problem is polynomial-time solvable when δ≤λ (via LCA-mapping), while if δ>λ the problem is NP-hard, even when λ=0 and a single gene tree is given, solving a long standing open problem on the complexity of multi-gene reconciliation. On the positive side, we give a fixed-parameter algorithm for the problem, where the parameters are δ/λ and the number d of segmental duplications, of time complexity O(⌈δλ⌉d⋅n⋅δλ). Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of this algorithm on two previously studied real datasets: we first show that our method can be used to confirm or raise doubt on hypothetical segmental duplications on a set of 16 eukaryotes, then show how we can detect whole genome duplications in yeast genomes.',\n",
              " 'Connectivity problems on heterogeneous graphs\\n\\nNetwork connectivity problems are abundant in computational biology research, where graphs are used to represent a range of phenomena: from physical interactions between molecules to more abstract relationships such as gene co-expression. One common challenge in studying biological networks is the need to extract meaningful, small subgraphs out of large databases of potential interactions. A useful abstraction for this task turned out to be the Steiner Network problems: given a reference “database” graph, find a parsimonious subgraph that satisfies a given set of connectivity demands. While this formulation proved useful in a number of instances, the next challenge is to account for the fact that the reference graph may not be static. This can happen for instance, when studying protein measurements in single cells or at different time points, whereby different subsets of conditions can have different protein milieu. We introduce the condition Steiner Network problem in which we concomitantly consider a set of distinct biological conditions. Each condition is associated with a set of connectivity demands, as well as a set of edges that are assumed to be present in that condition. The goal of this problem is to find a minimal subgraph that satisfies all the demands through paths that are present in the respective condition. We show that introducing multiple conditions as an additional factor makes this problem much harder to approximate. Specifically, we prove that for C conditions, this new problem is NP-hard to approximate to a factor of C−ϵ, for every C≥2 and ϵ>0, and that this bound is tight. Moving beyond the worst case, we explore a special set of instances where the reference graph grows monotonically between conditions, and show that this problem admits substantially improved approximation algorithms. We also developed an integer linear programming solver for the general problem and demonstrate its ability to reach optimality with instances from the human protein interaction network. Our results demonstrate that in contrast to most connectivity problems studied in computational biology, accounting for multiplicity of biological conditions adds considerable complexity, which we propose to address with a new solver. Importantly, our results extend to several network connectivity problems that are commonly used in computational biology, such as Prize-Collecting Steiner Tree, and provide insight into the theoretical guarantees for their applications in a multiple condition setting.',\n",
              " 'SNPs detection by eBWT positional clustering\\n\\nSequencing technologies keep on turning cheaper and faster, thus putting a growing pressure for data structures designed to efficiently store raw data, and possibly perform analysis therein. In this view, there is a growing interest in alignment-free and reference-free variants calling methods that only make use of (suitably indexed) raw reads data. We develop the positional clustering theory that (i) describes how the extended Burrows–Wheeler Transform (eBWT) of a collection of reads tends to cluster together bases that cover the same genome position (ii) predicts the size of such clusters, and (iii) exhibits an elegant and precise LCP array based procedure to locate such clusters in the eBWT. Based on this theory, we designed and implemented an alignment-free and reference-free SNPs calling method, and we devised a consequent SNPs calling pipeline. Experiments on both synthetic and real data show that SNPs can be detected with a simple scan of the eBWT and LCP arrays as, in accordance with our theoretical framework, they are within clusters in the eBWT of the reads. Finally, our tool intrinsically performs a reference-free evaluation of its accuracy by returning the coverage of each SNP. Based on the results of the experiments on synthetic and real data, we conclude that the positional clustering framework can be effectively used for the problem of identifying SNPs, and it appears to be a promising approach for calling other type of variants directly on raw sequencing data.

              " 'Constrained incremental tree building: new absolute fast converging phylogeny estimation methods with improved scalability and accuracy\\n\\nAbsolute fast converging (AFC) phylogeny estimation methods are ones that have been proven to recover the true tree with high probability given sequences whose lengths are polynomial in the number of number of leaves in the tree (once the shortest and longest branch weights are fixed). While there has been a large literature on AFC methods, the best in terms of empirical performance was DCMNJ, published in SODA 2001. The main empirical advantage of DCMNJ over other AFC methods is its use of neighbor joining (NJ) to construct trees on smaller taxon subsets, which are then combined into a tree on the full set of species using a supertree method; in contrast, the other AFC methods in essence depend on quartet trees that are computed independently of each other, which reduces accuracy compared to neighbor joining. However, DCMNJ is unlikely to scale to large datasets due to its reliance on supertree methods, as no current supertree methods are able to scale to large datasets with high accuracy. In this study we present a new approach to large-scale phylogeny estimation that shares some of the features of DCMNJ but bypasses the use of supertree methods. We prove that this new approach is AFC and uses polynomial time and space. Furthermore, we describe variations on this basic approach that can be used with leaf-disjoint constraint trees (computed using methods such as maximum likelihood) to produce other methods that are likely to provide even better accuracy. Thus, we present a new generalizable technique for large-scale tree estimation that is designed to improve scalability for phylogeny estimation methods to ultra-large datasets, and that can be used in a variety of settings (including tree estimation from unaligned sequences, and species tree estimation from gene trees).',\n",

Here we present a procedure to efficiently, reliably and automatically assign partial atomic charges to atoms based on known distributions. We formally introduce the molecular charge assignment problem, where the task is to select a charge from a set of candidate charges for every atom of a given query molecule. Charges are accompanied by a score that depends on their observed frequency in similar neighbourhoods (chemical environments) in a database of previously parameterised molecules. The aim is to assign the charges such that the total charge equals a known target charge within a margin of error while maximizing the sum of the charge scores. We show that the problem is a variant of the well-studied multiple-choice knapsack problem and thus weakly NP-complete. We propose solutions based on Integer Linear Programming and a pseudo-polynomial time Dynamic Programming algorithm. We demonstrate that the results obtained for novel molecules not included in the database are comparable to the ones obtained performing explicit charge calculations while decreasing the time to determine partial charges for a molecule from hours or even days to below a second. Our software is openly available.',\n",

Functional genomics experiments extend their potential. They typically generate sequence lists ranked by an experimentally acquired functional property such as gene expression or protein binding affinity. Current motif discovery tools suffer from limitations in searching large motif spaces, and thus more complex motifs may not be included. There is thus a need for motif analysis methods that are tailored for analyzing specific complex motifs motivated by biological questions and hypotheses rather than acting as a screen based motif finding tool. We present Regmex (REGular expression Motif EXplorer), which offers several methods to identify overrepresented motifs in ranked lists of sequences. Regmex uses regular expressions to define motifs or families of motifs and embedded Markov models to calculate exact p-values for motif observations in sequences. Biases in motif distributions across ranked sequence lists are evaluated using random walks, Brownian bridges, or modified rank based statistics. A modular setup and fast analytic p value evaluations make Regmex applicable to diverse and potentially large-scale motif analysis problems. We demonstrate use cases of combined motifs on simulated data and on expression data from micro RNA transfection experiments. We confirm previously obtained results and demonstrate the usability of Regmex to test a specific hypothesis about the relative location of microRNA seed sites and U-rich motifs. We further compare the tool with an existing motif discovery tool and show increased sensitivity. Regmex is a useful and flexible tool to analyze motif hypotheses that relates to large data sets in functional genomics. The method is available as an R package (https://github.com/muhligs/regmex).',\n",

Their practical importance derives from the fact they are connected to their host graph by a single entrance and a single exit vertex, thus allowing them to be handled independently. Efficient algorithms for the enumeration of superbubbles are therefore of important for the processing of HTS data. Superbubbles can be identified within the strongly connected components of the input digraph after transforming them into directed acyclic graphs. The algorithm by Sung et al. (IEEE ACM Trans Comput Biol Bioinform 12:770–777, 2015) achieves this task in O(m log(m))-time. The extraction of superbubbles from the transformed components was later improved to by Brankovic et al. (Theor Comput Sci 609:374–383, 2016) resulting in an overall O(m+n)-time algorithm. A re-analysis of the mathematical structure of superbubbles showed that the construction of auxiliary DAGs from the strongly connected components in the work of Sung et al. missed some details that can lead to the reporting of false positive superbubbles. We propose an alternative, even simpler auxiliary graph that solved the problem and retains the linear running time for general digraph. Furthermore, we describe a simpler, space-efficient O(m+n)-time algorithm for detecting superbubbles in DAGs that uses only simple data structures. We present a reference implementation of the algorithm that accepts many commonly used formats for the input graph and provides convenient access to the improved algorithm. https://github.com/Fabianexe/Superbubble.',\n",
              " 'Precise parallel volumetric comparison of molecular surfaces and electrostatic isopotentials\\n\\nGeometric comparisons of binding sites and their electrostatic properties can identify subtle variations that select different binding partners and subtle similarities that accommodate similar partners. Because subtle features are central for explaining how proteins achieve specificity, algorithmic efficiency and geometric precision are central to algorithmic design. To address these concerns, this paper presents pClay, the first algorithm to perform parallel and arbitrarily precise comparisons of molecular surfaces and electrostatic isopotentials as geometric solids. pClay was presented at the 2019 Workshop on Algorithms in Bioinformatics (WABI 2019) and is described in expanded detail here, especially with regard to the comparison of electrostatic isopotentials. Earlier methods have generally used parallelism to enhance computational throughput, pClay is the first algorithm to use parallelism to make arbitrarily high precision comparisons practical. It is also the first method to demonstrate that high precision comparisons of geometric solids can yield more precise structural inferences than algorithms that use existing standards of precision. One advantage of added precision is that statistical models can be trained with more accurate data. Using structural data from an existing method, a model of steric variations between binding cavities can overlook 53% of authentic steric influences on specificity, whereas a model trained with data from pClay overlooks none. Our results also demonstrate the parallel performance of pClay on both workstation CPUs and a 61-core Xeon Phi. While slower on one core, additional processor cores rapidly outpaced single core performance and existing methods. Based on these results, it is clear that pClay has applications in the automatic explanation of binding mechanisms and in the rational design of protein binding preferences.',\n",
              " 'Coordinate systems for supergenomes\\n\\nGenome sequences and genome annotation data have become available at ever increasing rates in response to the rapid progress in sequencing technologies. As a consequence the demand for methods supporting comparative, evolutionary analysis is also growing. In particular, efficient tools to visualize-omics data simultaneously for multiple species are sorely lacking. A first and crucial step in this direction is the construction of a common coordinate system. Since genomes not only differ by rearrangements but also by large insertions, deletions, and duplications, the use of a single reference genome is insufficient, in particular when the number of species becomes large. The computational problem then becomes to determine an order and orientations of optimal local alignments that are as co-linear as possible with all the genome sequences. We first review the most prominent approaches to model the problem formally and then proceed to showing that it can be phrased as a particular variant of the BETWEENNESS PROBLEM. It is NP hard in general. As exact solutions are beyond reach for the problem sizes of practical interest, we introduce a collection of heuristic simplifiers to resolve ordering conflicts. Benchmarks on real-life data ranging from bacterial to fly genomes demonstrate the feasibility of computing good common coordinate systems.',\n",
              " 'Improved de novo peptide sequencing using LC retention time information\\n\\nLiquid chromatography combined with tandem mass spectrometry is an important tool in proteomics for peptide identification. Liquid chromatography temporally separates the peptides in a sample. The peptides that elute one after another are analyzed via tandem mass spectrometry by measuring the mass-to-charge ratio of a peptide and its fragments. De novo peptide sequencing is the problem of reconstructing the amino acid sequences of a peptide from this measurement data. Past de novo sequencing algorithms solely consider the mass spectrum of the fragments for reconstructing a sequence. We propose to additionally exploit the information obtained from liquid chromatography. We study the problem of computing a sequence that is not only in accordance with the experimental mass spectrum, but also with the chromatographic retention time. We consider three models for predicting the retention time and develop algorithms for de novo sequencing for each model. Based on an evaluation for two prediction models on experimental data from synthesized peptides we conclude that the identification rates are improved by exploiting the chromatographic information. In our evaluation, we compare our algorithms using the retention time information with algorithms using the same scoring model, but not the retention time.',\n",
              " 'Sorting signed circular permutations by super short operations\\n\\nOne way to estimate the evolutionary distance between two given genomes is to determine the minimum number of large-scale mutations, or genome rearrangements, that are necessary to transform one into the other. In this context, genomes can be represented as ordered sequences of genes, each gene being represented by a signed integer. If no gene is repeated, genomes are thus modeled as signed permutations of the form \\\\pi =(\\\\pi _1 \\\\pi _2 \\\\ldots \\\\pi _n), and in that case we can consider without loss of generality that one of them is the identity permutation \\\\iota _n =(1 2 \\\\ldots n), and that we just need to sort the other (i.e., transform it into \\\\iota _n). The most studied genome rearrangement events are reversals, where a segment of the genome is reversed and reincorporated at the same location; and transpositions, where two consecutive segments are exchanged. Many variants, e.g., combining different types of (possibly constrained) rearrangements, have been proposed in the literature. One of them considers that the number of genes involved, in a reversal or a transposition, is never greater than two, which is known as the problem of sorting by super short operations (or SSOs). All problems considering SSOs in permutations have been shown to be in P, except for one, namely sorting signed circular permutations by super short reversals and super short transpositions. Here we fill this gap by introducing a new graph structure called cyclic permutation graph and providing a series of intermediate results, which allows us to design a polynomial algorithm for sorting signed circular permutations by super short reversals and super short transpositions.',\n",

Here we show that gap patterns in large-scale, genome-wide alignments are themselves phylogenetically informative and can be used to infer reliable phylogenies provided the gap data are properly filtered to reduce noise introduced by the alignment method. We introduce here the notion of split-inducing indels (splids) that define an approximate bipartition of the taxon set. We show both in simulated data and in case studies on real-life data that splids can be efficiently extracted from phylogenomic data sets. Suitably processed gap patterns extracted from genome-wide alignment provide a surprisingly clear phylogenetic signal and an allow the inference of accurate phylogenetic trees.',\n",
              " 'Locus-aware decomposition of gene trees with respect to polytomous species trees\\n\\nHorizontal gene transfer (HGT), a process of acquisition and fixation of foreign genetic material, is an important biological phenomenon. Several approaches to HGT inference have been proposed. However, most of them either rely on approximate, non-phylogenetic methods or on the tree reconciliation, which is computationally intensive and sensitive to parameter values. We investigate the locus tree inference problem as a possible alternative that combines the advantages of both approaches. We present several algorithms to solve the problem in the parsimony framework. We introduce a novel tree mapping, which allows us to obtain a heuristic solution to the problems of locus tree inference and duplication classification. Our approach allows for faster comparisons of gene and species trees and improves known algorithms for duplication inference in the presence of polytomies in the species trees. We have implemented our algorithms in a software tool available at https://github.com/mciach/LocusTreeInference.',\n",
              " 'A fast and accurate enumeration-based algorithm for haplotyping a triploid individual\\n\\nHaplotype assembly, reconstructing haplotypes from sequence data, is one of the major computational problems in bioinformatics. Most of the current methodologies for haplotype assembly are designed for diploid individuals. In recent years, genomes having more than two sets of homologous chromosomes have attracted many research groups that are interested in the genomics of disease, phylogenetics, botany and evolution. However, there is still a lack of methods for reconstructing polyploid haplotypes. In this work, the minimum error correction with genotype information (MEC/GI) model, an important combinatorial model for haplotyping a single individual, is used to study the triploid individual haplotype reconstruction problem. A fast and accurate enumeration-based algorithm enumeration haplotyping triploid with least difference (EHTLD) is proposed for solving the MEC/GI model. The EHTLD algorithm tries to reconstruct the three haplotypes according to the order of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci along them. When reconstructing a given SNP site, the EHTLD algorithm enumerates three kinds of SNP values in terms of the corresponding site’s genotype value, and chooses the one, which leads to the minimum difference between the reconstructed haplotypes and the sequenced fragments covering that SNP site, to fill the SNP loci being reconstructed. Extensive experimental comparisons were performed between the EHTLD algorithm and the well known HapCompass and HapTree. Compared with algorithms HapCompass and HapTree, the EHTLD algorithm can reconstruct more accurate haplotypes, which were proven by a number of experiments.',\n",
              " 'Finding local genome rearrangements\\n\\nThe double cut and join (DCJ) model of genome rearrangement is well studied due to its mathematical simplicity and power to account for the many events that transform gene order. These studies have mostly been devoted to the understanding of minimum length scenarios transforming one genome into another. In this paper we search instead for rearrangement scenarios that minimize the number of rearrangements whose breakpoints are unlikely due to some biological criteria. One such criterion has recently become accessible due to the advent of the Hi-C experiment, facilitating the study of 3D spacial distance between breakpoint regions. We establish a link between the minimum number of unlikely rearrangements required by a scenario and the problem of finding a maximum edge-disjoint cycle packing on a certain transformed version of the adjacency graph. This link leads to a 3/2-approximation as well as an exact integer linear programming formulation for our problem, which we prove to be NP-complete. We also present experimental results on fruit flies, showing that Hi-C data is informative when used as a criterion for rearrangements. A new variant of the weighted DCJ distance problem is addressed that ignores scenario length in its objective function. A solution to this problem provides a lower bound on the number of unlikely moves necessary when transforming one gene order into another. This lower bound aids in the study of rearrangement scenarios with respect to chromatin structure, and could eventually be used in the design of a fixed parameter algorithm with a more general objective function.',\n",
              " 'FSH: fast spaced seed hashing exploiting adjacent hashes\\n\\nPatterns with wildcards in specified positions, namely spaced seeds, are increasingly used instead of k-mers in many bioinformatics applications that require indexing, querying and rapid similarity search, as they can provide better sensitivity. Many of these applications require to compute the hashing of each position in the input sequences with respect to the given spaced seed, or to multiple spaced seeds. While the hashing of k-mers can be rapidly computed by exploiting the large overlap between consecutive k-mers, spaced seeds hashing is usually computed from scratch for each position in the input sequence, thus resulting in slower processing. The method proposed in this paper, fast spaced-seed hashing (FSH), exploits the similarity of the hash values of spaced seeds computed at adjacent positions in the input sequence. In our experiments we compute the hash for each positions of metagenomics reads from several datasets, with respect to different spaced seeds. We also propose a generalized version of the algorithm for the simultaneous computation of multiple spaced seeds hashing. In the experiments, our algorithm can compute the hashing values of spaced seeds with a speedup, with respect to the traditional approach, between 1.6× to 5.3×, depending on the structure of the spaced seed. Spaced seed hashing is a routine task for several bioinformatics application. FSH allows to perform this task efficiently and raise the question of whether other hashing can be exploited to further improve the speed up. This has the potential of major impact in the field, making spaced seed applications not only accurate, but also faster and more efficient.',\n",
              " 'Outlier detection in BLAST hits\\n\\nAn important task in a metagenomic analysis is the assignment of taxonomic labels to sequences in a sample. Most widely used methods for taxonomy assignment compare a sequence in the sample to a database of known sequences. Many approaches use the best BLAST hit(s) to assign the taxonomic label. However, it is known that the best BLAST hit may not always correspond to the best taxonomic match. An alternative approach involves phylogenetic methods, which take into account alignments and a model of evolution in order to more accurately define the taxonomic origin of sequences. Similarity-search based methods typically run faster than phylogenetic methods and work well when the organisms in the sample are well represented in the database. In contrast, phylogenetic methods have the capability to identify new organisms in a sample but are computationally quite expensive. We propose a two-step approach for metagenomic taxon identification; i.e., use a rapid method that accurately classifies sequences using a reference database (this is a filtering step) and then use a more complex phylogenetic method for the sequences that were unclassified in the previous step. In this work, we explore whether and when using top BLAST hit(s) yields a correct taxonomic label. We develop a method to detect outliers among BLAST hits in order to separate the phylogenetically most closely related matches from matches to sequences from more distantly related organisms. We used modified BILD (Bayesian Integral Log-Odds) scores, a multiple-alignment scoring function, to define the outliers within a subset of top BLAST hits and assign taxonomic labels. We compared the accuracy of our method to the RDP classifier and show that our method yields fewer misclassifications while properly classifying organisms that are not present in the database. Finally, we evaluated the use of our method as a pre-processing step before more expensive phylogenetic analyses (in our case TIPP) in the context of real 16S rRNA datasets. Our experiments make a good case for using a two-step approach for accurate taxonomic assignment. We show that our method can be used as a filtering step before using phylogenetic methods and provides a way to interpret BLAST results using more information than provided by E-values and bit-scores alone.',\n",
              " 'OCTAL: Optimal Completion of gene trees in polynomial time\\n\\nFor a combination of reasons (including data generation protocols, approaches to taxon and gene sampling, and gene birth and loss), estimated gene trees are often incomplete, meaning that they do not contain all of the species of interest. As incomplete gene trees can impact downstream analyses, accurate completion of gene trees is desirable. We introduce the Optimal Tree Completion problem, a general optimization problem that involves completing an unrooted binary tree (i.e., adding missing leaves) so as to minimize its distance from a reference tree on a superset of the leaves. We present OCTAL, an algorithm that finds an optimal solution to this problem when the distance between trees is defined using the Robinson–Foulds (RF) distance, and we prove that OCTAL runs in O(n2) time, where n is the total number of species. We report on a simulation study in which gene trees can differ from the species tree due to incomplete lineage sorting, and estimated gene trees are completed using OCTAL with a reference tree based on a species tree estimated from the multi-locus dataset. OCTAL produces completed gene trees that are closer to the true gene trees than an existing heuristic approach in ASTRAL-II, but the accuracy of a completed gene tree computed by OCTAL depends on how topologically similar the reference tree (typically an estimated species tree) is to the true gene tree. OCTAL is a useful technique for adding missing taxa to incomplete gene trees and provides good accuracy under a wide range of model conditions. However, results show that OCTAL’s accuracy can be reduced when incomplete lineage sorting is high, as the reference tree can be far from the true gene tree. Hence, this study suggests that OCTAL would benefit from using other types of reference trees instead of species trees when there are large topological distances between true gene trees and species trees.',\n",
              " 'The distance and median problems in the single-cut-or-join model with single-gene duplications\\n\\nIn the field of genome rearrangement algorithms, models accounting for gene duplication lead often to hard problems. For example, while computing the pairwise distance is tractable in most duplication-free models, the problem is NP-complete for most extensions of these models accounting for duplicated genes. Moreover, problems involving more than two genomes, such as the genome median and the Small Parsimony problem, are intractable for most duplication-free models, with some exceptions, for example the Single-Cut-or-Join (SCJ) model. We introduce a variant of the SCJ distance that accounts for duplicated genes, in the context of directed evolution from an ancestral genome to a descendant genome where orthology relations between ancestral genes and their descendant are known. Our model includes two duplication mechanisms: single-gene tandem duplication and the creation of single-gene circular chromosomes. We prove that in this model, computing the directed distance and a parsimonious evolutionary scenario in terms of SCJ and single-gene duplication events can be done in linear time. We also show that the directed median problem is tractable for this distance, while the rooted median problem, where we assume that one of the given genomes is ancestral to the median, is NP-complete. We also describe an Integer Linear Program for solving this problem. We evaluate the directed distance and rooted median algorithms on simulated data. Our results provide a simple genome rearrangement model, extending the SCJ model to account for single-gene duplications, for which we prove a mix of tractability and hardness results. For the NP-complete rooted median problem, we design a simple Integer Linear Program. Our publicly available implementation of these algorithms for the directed distance and median problems allow to solve efficiently these problems on large instances.',\n",
              " 'Derivative-free neural network for optimizing the scoring functions associated with dynamic programming of pairwise-profile alignment\\n\\nA profile-comparison method with position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) is among the most accurate alignment methods. Currently, cosine similarity and correlation coefficients are used as scoring functions of dynamic programming to calculate similarity between PSSMs. However, it is unclear whether these functions are optimal for profile alignment methods. By definition, these functions cannot capture nonlinear relationships between profiles. Therefore, we attempted to discover a novel scoring function, which was more suitable for the profile-comparison method than existing functions, using neural networks. Although neural networks required derivative-of-cost functions, the problem being addressed in this study lacked them. Therefore, we implemented a novel derivative-free neural network by combining a conventional neural network with an evolutionary strategy optimization method used as a solver. Using this novel neural network system, we optimized the scoring function to align remote sequence pairs. Our results showed that the pairwise-profile aligner using the novel scoring function significantly improved both alignment sensitivity and precision relative to aligners using existing functions. We developed and implemented a novel derivative-free neural network and aligner (Nepal) for optimizing sequence alignments. Nepal improved alignment quality by adapting to remote sequence alignments and increasing the expressiveness of similarity scores. Additionally, this novel scoring function can be realized using a simple matrix operation and easily incorporated into other aligners. Moreover our scoring function could potentially improve the performance of homology detection and/or multiple-sequence alignment of remote homologous sequences. The goal of the study was to provide a novel scoring function for profile alignment method and develop a novel learning system capable of addressing derivative-free problems. Our system is capable of optimizing the performance of other sophisticated methods and solving problems without derivative-of-cost functions, which do not always exist in practical problems. Our results demonstrated the usefulness of this optimization method for derivative-free problems.',\n",
              " 'Fast phylogenetic inference from typing data\\n\\nMicrobial typing methods are commonly used to study the relatedness of bacterial strains. Sequence-based typing methods are a gold standard for epidemiological surveillance due to the inherent portability of sequence and allelic profile data, fast analysis times and their capacity to create common nomenclatures for strains or clones. This led to development of several novel methods and several databases being made available for many microbial species. With the mainstream use of High Throughput Sequencing, the amount of data being accumulated in these databases is huge, storing thousands of different profiles. On the other hand, computing genetic evolutionary distances among a set of typing profiles or taxa dominates the running time of many phylogenetic inference methods. It is important also to note that most of genetic evolution distance definitions rely, even if indirectly, on computing the pairwise Hamming distance among sequences or profiles. We propose here an average-case linear-time algorithm to compute pairwise Hamming distances among a set of taxa under a given Hamming distance threshold. This article includes both a theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results concerning the proposed algorithm. We further show how this algorithm can be successfully integrated into a well known phylogenetic inference method, and how it can be used to speedup querying local phylogenetic patterns over large typing databases.',\n",
              " 'A safe and complete algorithm for metagenomic assembly\\n\\nReconstructing the genome of a species from short fragments is one of the oldest bioinformatics problems. Metagenomic assembly is a variant of the problem asking to reconstruct the circular genomes of all bacterial species present in a sequencing sample. This problem can be naturally formulated as finding a collection of circular walks of a directed graph G that together cover all nodes, or edges, of G. We address this problem with the “safe and complete” framework of Tomescu and Medvedev (Research in computational Molecular biology—20th annual conference, RECOMB 9649:152–163, 2016). An algorithm is called safe if it returns only those walks (also called safe) that appear as subwalk in all metagenomic assembly solutions for G. A safe algorithm is called complete if it returns all safe walks of G. We give graph-theoretic characterizations of the safe walks of G, and a safe and complete algorithm finding all safe walks of G. In the node-covering case, our algorithm runs in time O(m2+n3), and in the edge-covering case it runs in time O(m2n); n and m denote the number of nodes and edges, respectively, of G. This algorithm constitutes the first theoretical tight upper bound on what can be safely assembled from metagenomic reads using this problem formulation.',\n",
              " 'Time-consistent reconciliation maps and forbidden time travel\\n\\nIn the absence of horizontal gene transfer it is possible to reconstruct the history of gene families from empirically determined orthology relations, which are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees. Knowledge of the event labels considerably simplifies the problem of reconciling a gene tree T with a species trees S, relative to the reconciliation problem without prior knowledge of the event types. It is well-known that optimal reconciliations in the unlabeled case may violate time-consistency and thus are not biologically feasible. Here we investigate the mathematical structure of the event labeled reconciliation problem with horizontal transfer. We investigate the issue of time-consistency for the event-labeled version of the reconciliation problem, provide a convenient axiomatic framework, and derive a complete characterization of time-consistent reconciliations. This characterization depends on certain weak conditions on the event-labeled gene trees that reflect conditions under which evolutionary events are observable at least in principle. We give an O(|V(T)|log(|V(S)|))-time algorithm to decide whether a time-consistent reconciliation map exists. It does not require the construction of explicit timing maps, but relies entirely on the comparably easy task of checking whether a small auxiliary graph is acyclic. The algorithms are implemented in C++ using the boost graph library and are freely available at https://github.com/Nojgaard/tc-recon. The combinatorial characterization of time consistency and thus biologically feasible reconciliation is an important step towards the inference of gene family histories with horizontal transfer from orthology data, i.e., without presupposed gene and species trees. The fast algorithm to decide time consistency is useful in a broader context because it constitutes an attractive component for all tools that address tree reconciliation problems.',\n",

In its standard formulation, the objective is to find a species tree that minimizes the total number of gene duplications and losses with respect to the input set of gene trees. Although much is known about GTP, little is known about how to treat inputs containing some incomplete gene trees (i.e., gene trees lacking one or more of the species). We present new theory for GTP considering whether the incompleteness is due to gene birth and death (i.e., true biological loss) or taxon sampling, and present dynamic programming algorithms that can be used for an exact but exponential time solution for small numbers of taxa, or as a heuristic for larger numbers of taxa. We also prove that the “standard” calculations for duplications and losses exactly solve GTP when incompleteness results from taxon sampling, although they can be incorrect when incompleteness results from true biological loss.

The external memory construction of the generalized suffix array for a string collection is a fundamental task when the size of the input collection or the data structure exceeds the available internal memory. In this article we present and analyze eGSA [introduced in CPM (External memory generalized suffix and LCP arrays construction. In: Proceedings of CPM. pp 201–10, 2013)], the first external memory algorithm to construct generalized suffix arrays augmented with the longest common prefix array for a string collection. Our algorithm relies on a combination of buffers, induced sorting and a heap to avoid direct string comparisons. We performed experiments that covered different aspects of our algorithm, including running time, efficiency, external memory access, internal phases and the influence of different optimization strategies. On real datasets of size up to 24 GB and using 2 GB of internal memory, eGSA showed a competitive performance when compared to eSAIS and SAscan, which are efficient algorithms for a single string according to the related literature. We also show the effect of disk caching managed by the operating system on our algorithm. The proposed algorithm was validated through performance tests using real datasets from different domains, in various combinations, and showed a competitive performance. Our algorithm can also construct the generalized Burrows-Wheeler transform of a string collection with no additional cost except by the output time.',\n",
              " 'Algorithms for matching partially labelled sequence graphs\\n\\nIn order to find correlated pairs of positions between proteins, which are useful in predicting interactions, it is necessary to concatenate two large multiple sequence alignments such that the sequences that are joined together belong to those that interact in their species of origin. When each protein is unique then the species name is sufficient to guide this match, however, when there are multiple related sequences (paralogs) in each species then the pairing is more difficult. In bacteria a good guide can be gained from genome co-location as interacting proteins tend to be in a common operon but in eukaryotes this simple principle is not sufficient. The methods developed in this paper take sets of paralogs for different proteins found in the same species and make a pairing based on their evolutionary distance relative to a set of other proteins that are unique and so have a known relationship (singletons). The former constitute a set of unlabelled nodes in a graph while the latter are labelled. Two variants were tested, one based on a phylogenetic tree of the sequences (the topology-based method) and a simpler, faster variant based only on the inter-sequence distances (the distance-based method). Over a set of test proteins, both gave good results, with the topology method performing slightly better. The methods develop here still need refinement and augmentation from constraints other than the sequence data alone, such as known interactions from annotation and databases, or non-trivial relationships in genome location. With the ever growing numbers of eukaryotic genomes, it is hoped that the methods described here will open a route to the use of these data equal to the current success attained with bacterial sequences.',\n",
              " 'Biologically feasible gene trees, reconciliation maps and informative triples\\n\\nThe history of gene families—which are equivalent to event-labeled gene trees—can be reconstructed from empirically estimated evolutionary event-relations containing pairs of orthologous, paralogous or xenologous genes. The question then arises as whether inferred event-labeled gene trees are biologically feasible, that is, if there is a possible true history that would explain a given gene tree. In practice, this problem is boiled down to finding a reconciliation map—also known as DTL-scenario—between the event-labeled gene trees and a (possibly unknown) species tree. In this contribution, we first characterize whether there is a valid reconciliation map for binary event-labeled gene trees T that contain speciation, duplication and horizontal gene transfer events and some unknown species tree S in terms of “informative” triples that are displayed in T and provide information of the topology of S. These informative triples are used to infer the unknown species tree S for T. We obtain a similar result for non-binary gene trees. To this end, however, the reconciliation map needs to be further restricted. We provide a polynomial-time algorithm to decide whether there is a species tree for a given event-labeled gene tree, and in the positive case, to construct the species tree and the respective (restricted) reconciliation map. However, informative triples as well as DTL-scenarios have their limitations when they are used to explain the biological feasibility of gene trees. While reconciliation maps imply biological feasibility, we show that the converse is not true in general. Moreover, we show that informative triples neither provide enough information to characterize “relaxed” DTL-scenarios nor non-restricted reconciliation maps for non-binary biologically feasible gene trees.',\n",
              " 'Partially local three-way alignments and the sequence signatures of mitochondrial genome rearrangements\\n\\nGenomic DNA frequently undergoes rearrangement of the gene order that can be localized by comparing the two DNA sequences. In mitochondrial genomes different mechanisms are likely at work, at least some of which involve the duplication of sequence around the location of the apparent breakpoints. We hypothesize that these different mechanisms of genome rearrangement leave distinctive sequence footprints. In order to study such effects it is important to locate the breakpoint positions with precision. We define a partially local sequence alignment problem that assumes that following a rearrangement of a sequence F, two fragments L, and R are produced that may exactly fit together to match F, leave a gap of deleted DNA between L and R, or overlap with each other. We show that this alignment problem can be solved by dynamic programming in cubic space and time. We apply the new method to evaluate rearrangements of animal mitogenomes and find that a surprisingly large fraction of these events involved local sequence duplications. The partially local sequence alignment method is an effective way to investigate the mechanism of genomic rearrangement events. While applied here only to mitogenomes there is no reason why the method could not be used to also consider rearrangements in nuclear genomes.',\n",
              " 'Non-parametric and semi-parametric support estimation using SEquential RESampling random walks on biomolecular sequences\\n\\nNon-parametric and semi-parametric resampling procedures are widely used to perform support estimation in computational biology and bioinformatics. Among the most widely used methods in this class is the standard bootstrap method, which consists of random sampling with replacement. While not requiring assumptions about any particular parametric model for resampling purposes, the bootstrap and related techniques assume that sites are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). The i.i.d. assumption can be an over-simplification for many problems in computational biology and bioinformatics. In particular, sequential dependence within biomolecular sequences is often an essential biological feature due to biochemical function, evolutionary processes such as recombination, and other factors. To relax the simplifying i.i.d. assumption, we propose a new non-parametric/semi-parametric sequential resampling technique that generalizes “Heads-or-Tails” mirrored inputs, a simple but clever technique due to Landan and Graur. The generalized procedure takes the form of random walks along either aligned or unaligned biomolecular sequences. We refer to our new method as the SERES (or “SEquential RESampling”) method. To demonstrate the performance of the new technique, we apply SERES to estimate support for the multiple sequence alignment problem. Using simulated and empirical data, we show that SERES-based support estimation yields comparable or typically better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.',\n",

However, maximum likelihood parameter estimation with beta distributions suffers from problems because of singularities in the log-likelihood function if some observations take the values 0 or 1. While ad-hoc corrections have been proposed to mitigate this problem, we propose a different approach to parameter estimation for beta mixtures where such problems do not arise in the first place. Our algorithm combines latent variables with the method of moments instead of maximum likelihood, which has computational advantages over the popular EM algorithm. As an application, we demonstrate that methylation state classification is more accurate when using adaptive thresholds from beta mixtures than non-adaptive thresholds on observed methylation levels. We also demonstrate that we can accurately infer the number of mixture components. The hybrid algorithm between likelihood-based component un-mixing and moment-based parameter estimation is a robust and efficient method for beta mixture estimation. We provide an implementation of the method (“betamix”) as open source software under the MIT license.',\n",

The first problem arises when comparing two trees where the leaf set of one tree is a proper subset of the other. The second problem arises when the two trees to be compared have only partially overlapping leaf sets. The traditional approach to handling these problems is to first restrict the two trees to their common leaf set. An alternative approach that has shown promise is to first complete the trees by adding missing leaves, so that the resulting trees have identical leaf sets. This requires the computation of an optimal completion that minimizes the distance between the two resulting trees over all possible completions.\\nWe provide optimal linear-time algorithms for both completion problems under the widely-used Robinson–Foulds (RF) distance measure. Our algorithm for the first problem improves the time complexity of the current fastest algorithm from quadratic (in the size of the two trees) to linear. No algorithms have yet been proposed for the more general second problem where both trees have missing leaves. We advance the study of this general problem by proposing a useful restricted version of the general problem and providing optimal linear-time algorithms for the restricted version. Our experimental results on biological data sets suggest that completion-based RF distances can be very different compared to traditional RF distances.',\n",
              " 'From pairs of most similar sequences to phylogenetic best matches\\n\\nMany of the commonly used methods for orthology detection start from mutually most similar pairs of genes (reciprocal best hits) as an approximation for evolutionary most closely related pairs of genes (reciprocal best matches). This approximation of best matches by best hits becomes exact for ultrametric dissimilarities, i.e., under the Molecular Clock Hypothesis. It fails, however, whenever there are large lineage specific rate variations among paralogous genes. In practice, this introduces a high level of noise into the input data for best-hit-based orthology detection methods. If additive distances between genes are known, then evolutionary most closely related pairs can be identified by considering certain quartets of genes provided that in each quartet the outgroup relative to the remaining three genes is known. A priori knowledge of underlying species phylogeny greatly facilitates the identification of the required outgroup. Although the workflow remains a heuristic since the correct outgroup cannot be determined reliably in all cases, simulations with lineage specific biases and rate asymmetries show that nearly perfect results can be achieved. In a realistic setting, where distances data have to be estimated from sequence data and hence are noisy, it is still possible to obtain highly accurate sets of best matches.',\n",

A common task is the inference of phylogenies—a challenging task if close reference sequences are not available, genome sequences are incompletely assembled, or the high number of genomes precludes multiple sequence alignment in reasonable time. We present a new whole-genome based approach to infer phylogenies that is alignment- and reference-free. In contrast to other methods, it does not rely on pairwise comparisons to determine distances to infer edges in a tree. Instead, a colored de Bruijn graph is constructed, and information on common subsequences is extracted to infer phylogenetic splits. The introduced new methodology for large-scale phylogenomics shows high potential. Application to different datasets confirms robustness of the approach. A comparison to other state-of-the-art whole-genome based methods indicates comparable or higher accuracy and efficiency.',\n",
              " 'GrpClassifierEC: a novel classification approach based on the ensemble clustering space\\n\\nAdvances in molecular biology have resulted in big and complicated data sets, therefore a clustering approach that able to capture the actual structure and the hidden patterns of the data is required. Moreover, the geometric space may not reflects the actual similarity between the different objects. As a result, in this research we use clustering-based space that convert the geometric space of the molecular to a categorical space based on clustering results. Then we use this space for developing a new classification algorithm. In this study, we propose a new classification method named GrpClassifierEC that replaces the given data space with categorical space based on ensemble clustering (EC). The EC space is defined by tracking the membership of the points over multiple runs of clustering algorithms. Different points that were included in the same clusters will be represented as a single point. Our algorithm classifies all these points as a single class. The similarity between two objects is defined as the number of times that these objects were not belong to the same cluster. In order to evaluate our suggested method, we compare its results to the k nearest neighbors, Decision tree and Random forest classification algorithms on several benchmark datasets. The results confirm that the suggested new algorithm GrpClassifierEC outperforms the other algorithms. Our algorithm can be integrated with many other algorithms. In this research, we use only the k-means clustering algorithm with different k values. In future research, we propose several directions: (1) checking the effect of the clustering algorithm to build an ensemble clustering space. (2) Finding poor clustering results based on the training data, (3) reducing the volume of the data by combining similar points based on the EC.',\n",
