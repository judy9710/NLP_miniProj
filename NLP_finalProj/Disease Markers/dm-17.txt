The Accuracy of Single MicroRNAs in Peripheral Blood to Diagnose Ovarian Cancer: An Updated Meta-Analysis

Background. Ovarian cancer is the 5th leading cause of death of women due to cancer in the United States. Although carbohydrate antigen 125 has a moderate diagnostic utility, the phenomenon of false-positive exists. As novel effective biomarkers, some single microRNAs (miRNAs) have diagnostic values for ovarian cancer, but the results lack consistency. In order to precisely and comprehensively assess the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer, a meta-analysis is performed. Methods. Articles concerning the diagnostic value of single miRNAs for ovarian cancer were searched from databases. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. Area under curve (AUC) of the summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curve was also calculated. Results. In total, 22 studies including 8 kinds of single miRNAs were enrolled in this paper (6 studies for miR-200c, 3 studies for miR-200a and miR-200b, and 2 studies for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b). For miR-200c, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.768 (95% CI: 0.722-0.811) and 0.680 (95% CI: 0.624-0.732); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 2.897 (95% CI: 1.787-4.698) and 0.340 (95% CI: 0.276-0.417); the pooled DOR was 8.917 (95% CI: 4.521-17.587); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.815. For miR-200a, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.759 (95% CI: 0.670-0.833) and 0.717 (95% CI: 0.627-0.795); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 3.129 (95% CI: 0.997-9.816) and 0.301 (95% CI: 0.207-0.437); the pooled DOR was 11.323 (95% CI: 3.493-36.711); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.857. For miR-200b, the pooled SEN and SPE were, respectively, 0.853 (95% CI: 0.776-0.912) and 0.775 (95% CI: 0.690-0.846); the pooled PLR and NLR were, respectively, 4.327 (95% CI: 0.683-27.415) and 0.225 (95% CI: 0.081-0.625); the pooled DOR was 19.678 (95% CI: 2.812-137.72); and AUC of SROC curve was 0.90. For miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b, each diagnostic value should be interpreted cautiously because only two studies were included. Conclusions. miR-200c, miR-200a, and miR-200b can be useful diagnostic biomarkers for ovarian cancer. More related studies are needed for miR-205, miR-145, miR-141, miR-429, and miR-125b.
