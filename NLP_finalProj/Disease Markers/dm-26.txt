The Crucial Role of CXCL8 and Its Receptors in Colorectal Liver Metastasis

CXCL8 (also known as IL-8) can produce different biological effects by binding to its receptors: CXCR1, CXCR2, and the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). CXCL8 and its receptors are associated with the development of various tumor types, especially colorectal cancer and its liver metastases. In addition to promoting angiogenesis, proliferation, invasion, migration, and the survival of colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, CXCL8 and its receptors have also been known to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of CRC cells, to help them to escape host immunosurveillance as well as to enhance resistance to anoikis, which promotes the formation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and their colonization of distant organs. In this paper, we will review the established roles of CXCL8 signaling in CRC and discuss the possible strategies of targeting CXCL8 signaling for overcoming CRC drug resistance and cancer progression, including direct targeting of CXCL8/CXCR1/2 or indirect targeting through the inhibition of CXCL8-CXCR1/2 signaling.
