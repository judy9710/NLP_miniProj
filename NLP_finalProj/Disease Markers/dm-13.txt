Short-Term Prognosis Value of sST2 for an Unfavorable Outcome in Hypertensive Patients

Background. sST2 represents a useful biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with heart failure, but limited data is available on its role in patients with hypertension. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short-term prognosis value of sST2 for an unfavorable outcome in hypertensive patients. Methods. This was a prospective observational study which enrolled 80 patients with hypertension, who were followed for one year. All patients underwent clinical, laboratory (including sST2), and echocardiographic assessment at baseline. The patients were grouped according to the cardiovascular (CV) events reported during the follow-up: group A (with CV events) and group B (without CV events). Results. Overall, 59 CV events were reported during the follow-up period. Compared to group B, the patients in group A had significantly higher sST2 levels, a higher number of CV risk factors, and a higher left ventricle mass. Except for the diastolic dysfunction parameters, the echocardiographic findings were similar in the two groups. Patients in group A had a lower  ratio, larger deceleration time, and increased telediastolic pressure as quantified by the  ratio than those in group B. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sST2 and fasting plasma glucose at baseline were independent predictors for the CV events reported during the follow-up period.  were associated with poor clinical outcomes (, Kaplan-Meier analysis). Conclusions. sST2 levels were correlated with the risk of adverse CV outcomes in hypertensive patients and may represent a useful prognostic marker in these patients.
