FASN Protein Overexpression Indicates Poor Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer

Backgrounds. Fatty acid synthase (FASN) has been regarded as a prognostic marker in prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we evaluated FASN expression at both mRNA and protein levels and assessed the association between FASN expression and prognosis in male Han Chinese with PCa treated with radical prostatectomy (RP). Methods. Expression profile and prognostic value of FASN were analyzed in tissue microarray (TMA) and data retrieved from databases including TCGA public database, GEO database, and our sequencing data with whole clinicopathological characteristics. Results. FASN expression was associated with clinical parameters and biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. The relative expression of FASN mRNA was higher in the tumor tissue in all public databases and our sequencing data (). A similar result was seen in tissue microarray (TMA) (). Analysis of our sequencing data indicated that FASNâ€™s relative expression was associated with tumor stage (), and FASN expression was positively associated with the Gleason score () and seminal vesicle invasion () in TMA. We found that high FASN expression was an independent predictor of shorter BCR-free survival with univariate and multivariate survival analysis (), rendering FASN an optimal prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with prostate cancer. Conclusions. Our study demonstrated that FASN was overexpressed at mRNA and protein levels in PCa. We found that patients with high FASN expression had a shorter BCR-free survival, showing its value as a prognostic biomarker in male Han Chinese with PCa.
