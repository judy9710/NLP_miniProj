Alterations of Several Serum Parameters Are Associated with Preeclampsia and May Be Potential Markers for the Assessment of PE Severity

The precise pathophysiological mechanisms of preeclampsia (PE) and preventative strategies remain unknown. Laboratory markers which can help in identifying PE patients from pregnant women and assessing the severity of PE during pregnancy are worthy to be explored. In this study, a retrospective case-control study was designed to assess whether the serum levels of albumin (ALB), total protein (TP), prealbumin (PA), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), D-dimer, fibrinogen (Fbg), platelet (PLT) count, mean platelet volume (MPV), and platelet distribution width (PDW) can help in assessing PE and evaluate its severity. 256 pregnant women were enrolled and classified into 3 groups: mild preeclampsia (mPE, ), severe preeclampsia (sPE, ), and healthy normotensive controls (control, ). Our result showed that the serum levels of ALP, LDH, and D-dimer were significantly higher in mild or severe PE patients compared with the healthy controls (66 (52.5-76.5) vs. 168 (141.5-201.25) vs. 182.5 (120-191.5), 152 (139.75-166.25) vs. 183.5 (163.25-307) vs. 282 (215.25-306), 1.05 (0.65-1.57) vs. 3.05 (2.25-4.08) vs. 5.65 (2.29-7.71)), while ALB, TP, and PA are lower (38 (37-42) vs. 31.5 (25.5-34.5) vs. 28.5 (24-33), 65 (63-68.25) vs. 56.5 (52-61) vs. 51.5 (49-58),  vs.  vs. ). On the other hand, compared with the mPE group, the sPE group showed significantly lower PLT count but higher level of LDH, D-dimer, and Fbg. No significant differences in MPV or PDW were found between any of the two groups. In conclusion, the above markers except for the MPV and PDW may be correlated with PE severity in this patient cohort, indicating possible values of these potential biomarkers in auxiliary diagnosis and severity assessment of PE.
