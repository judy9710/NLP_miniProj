Alignment- and reference-free phylogenomics with colored de Bruijn graphs

The increasing amount of available genome sequence data enables large-scale comparative studies. A common task is the inference of phylogeniesâ€”a challenging task if close reference sequences are not available, genome sequences are incompletely assembled, or the high number of genomes precludes multiple sequence alignment in reasonable time. We present a new whole-genome based approach to infer phylogenies that is alignment- and reference-free. In contrast to other methods, it does not rely on pairwise comparisons to determine distances to infer edges in a tree. Instead, a colored de Bruijn graph is constructed, and information on common subsequences is extracted to infer phylogenetic splits. The introduced new methodology for large-scale phylogenomics shows high potential. Application to different datasets confirms robustness of the approach. A comparison to other state-of-the-art whole-genome based methods indicates comparable or higher accuracy and efficiency.
